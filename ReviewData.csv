Review
I have stayed at this hotel 2 imes and both times we've really enjoyed the lady at the front desk. She is always so helpful. Great coffee and breakfast. Nice/clean and always helpful. We will always stay at this hotel when traveling to atlanta.
"I would highly recommend Hyatt Regency Atlanta to my friends and family.  Rooms were clean and newly renovated and the staff was always pleasant.  Even though we were in the middle of Atlanta, it definitely had a"
Stayed here for one night. Decent hotel in proximity to the airport. Nice room and lovely staff. Would recommend to those who need to be close to the airport. But this is  definitely a no thrills location
The breakfast was powdered eggs and microwave pancakes.  The mattress on the bed in our room was worn out.  It sunk toward the middle.  The location was where we needed to be for our visit and was convenient to the aquarium and Coca Cola.
"This is a wonderful hotel, clean, great location.  This hotel is newly renovated so it is great for family getaway, couple retreat, friend getaway.  I would stay here again.  I had to pay for parking which was surprising!!!"
Very clean. Staff was friendly and always willing to help with any concerns. Room was laid out well even for small children. Would highly recommend this location. Especially when the new baseball stadium is completed!
"Excellent staff!! Very helpfu! I would definitely recommend this hotel! Fabulous seafood restaurant attached to hotel! Plus, a arcade for kids and adults! The aquarium is literally across the street and other amenities are within a short walk."
"Very good hotel in Atlanta near the Cobb Centre and Cumberland Mall.  Nice comfortable rooms with two large screen TV's.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Convenient to to I-285 and I-75.  The excellent Marietta Diner is about five miles down Cobb Pwky."
"This trip was to access Emory Hospital.  The location is great.  For the price, the hotel was not comparable to other Doubletree Hotels in other locations around the country.  Even after recent construction upgrades, the hotel is very plain and overpriced."
The staff at the hotel was super nice! The rooms were clean and very modern. It was an absolute delight staying here. I would definately recommend this hotel to my friends and family back home. Great stay overall!
"Clean, good beds, very good climate control, full and soft towels.  During big cheerleading event, elevators have a hard time keeping up with demand.  Parking is expensive and the most offensive.  Sufficient dining options within walking distance."
"Great location when in Buckhead. Rooms always clean. Very friendly staff too. Breakfast above average,  really good during the week days when they make omelets"
"Great location, helpful staff, clean and free of smoke. Quiet room with comfortable bed. Great deal overall and pleasant stay. Would stay again. Easy access, early check-in with mobile apps and reminders is a plus."
"Room great, staff professional yet welcoming & friendly. Breakfast offerings great. Free parking , hotel location was in a great place surrounded by shopping and eateries. No problems during my visit."
The gal that works the evening managers reception is fantastic! Hotel visit was really good but our server pushed it over the top. She was super attentive and the food was great. I have stayed at many homewood suites and the people make the difference!
"Thx. so very much for your review, and for being our guest. We're so glad to hear our team could be of service during your stay! Please come back again, soon!"
It was wonderful to read your review and for you to share with the community your experience at my hotel.  Thank you again and look forward to your return visit. Cheers- Zach
"We stayed at the Marriott Hotel in Atlanta/Vinings, it was amazing. Clean, friendly, great customer service, understanding staff. The room was huge, and I fell in love with the spacious bathroom. I would stay here again,  just didnt like the parking situation. Overall,  great stay."
"The service and facilities provided on the part of Aloft were superb. However, our room access was substantially delayed on the first day of our reservation. However, they later apologized for the circumstances surrounding our arrival."
We picked this hotel because they accepted pets but it really wasn't very nice for the price we paid.  The hotel is under construction so there are a lot of noises during the day.  The staff is helpful though.
The accommodations met my need for the trip. Very close to the airport and very happy that the provided free airport shuttle. Room was clean and staff was polite. I would recommend this location to all

"New, beautiful, serene environment, wonderful location, staff was very friendly & helpful.  The gardens were tranquil and the food at Villa Christina was very good.  Will definitely stay here again on my next visit to Atlanta Perimeter area!"
We had a very pleasant stay.  All staff were very hospitable nothing was too much for them.breakfast was sufficient and a good selection of hot and cold. Happy hour is good value. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from Peachtree station.
Big thanks to Mellissa at the front Counter. Needed Last minute alteration to my suit before a Wedding! She said no problem - took out a sewing kit and helped me stitch a Rip! Awesome job and hands down great experience.
"Thx. so much for your review! We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and our great outdoor pool! Please do come back and stay with us again!"
Booked hotel without knowing about construction.  There is enough inconvenience and noise that I would not have booked it if I had known.  Although good location for buckhead I would avoid until construction is complete.  There are many other alternatives.
The garbage dumpsters outside my window were emptied at 8am! Woke everyone up! The pullout mattress was dirty with crumbs or something. There was hair on the bathroom floor. Not acceptable for the price
"Location was good.  The following problems were  shower not cleaned properly, coffee machine did not work,inadequate supply of condiments to make coffee. Poor directions for parking for those that drive. Parking services were awful."
The room was very comfortable and quiet.  Facilities were wonderful. The heat and air system worked very well and the thermostat did allow positive control of the temperature.  Breakfast was delightful and the service in the restaurant was excellent.
"We stayed here for just one night and it was a great stay.  The staff was friendly and helpful, recommending places to eat and drink.  They even provided a shuttle to the restaurant!  Our room was clean and comfortable."
"Glood area,nice breakfast,good reception service,spacious area,big rooms,fine bathrooms, nice swimming pool,huge area for car parking,nearby Kentucky & Mcdonald, free airport service.Nice walking area inside,nearby airport.
Tidy lobby area."
"Decided to stay here on my visit and was quite impressed. The staff were professional, friendly, and even made me laugh.  I liked my room, comfortable king sized bed and spacious bathroom.  Wouldn't mind staying again."
Great temperature control. Bed very comfortable. Wide variety of pillows (and lots of them). Quite. Comfortable desk chair. Fast internet. Close to the Georgia World Congress Center. Friendly staff. Have stayed here before and will stay again.
The bartender was extremely knowledgeable on drinks and wines!!  Rooms were clean.  Wish they had a coffee machine though...the Ritz where we stayed the night before had a Nespresso machine in the room!
"If you are looking for a hotel with a complete package, try the Embassy Suites.  They have it all. Yes everything you need from toothbrush, toothpaste to great service. Try them once and I guarantee you will return."
"Very much enjoyed our stay this past weekend! This was our 4-5 time staying at Embassy-Atlanta Airport and we most definitely will be back. We enjoy the great breakfast each visit as well. Thanks for always being clean, neat, courteous and welcoming!"
"Stayed here as part of a professional conference. The service was excellent, and the room was great with a balcony. Closed to attractions like the Coca Cola Museum and the Aquarium. The restaurant food was fantastic. Has a 24-hr coffee bar with Starbucks."
"From the check in to the checkout everything was wonderful.  Kind workers, clean room, wonderful breakfast all at a fair price! Let's not forget the warm cookies.

There is construction in the area, however it was not a deal breaker."
"Very friendly staff, great room, awesome price, and an enclosed parking lot for a nominal fee!  Conveniently located close to the airport if you have a rental car.  I did see shuttles entering the facility though. Hotel restaurant was also very tasty!"
Very nice accommodations with a good selection of restaurants as well as an enclosed walkway to mall. A large open lobby bar with big screen television. Valet Parking is also available if needed albeit a little pricey.
"Staff was very helpful. Rooms clean, restaurant a little pricey, Overall a great place to stay"
"One of the best experiences I've had in an Atlanta hotel.  Very welcoming staff, quick check-in and bag delivery, and just overall impressed with the cleanliness &  professional presentation of the hotel over all.
Worth the $$."
"This hotel is very clean and is 8n a great location in Atlanta. The room was very clean. I think for the money, that they should provide a microwave in the room. The restaurant need a vegan option menu.Free parking should be available."
"After a long day of meetings, I walked in to a sauna and was a little disappointed to have to wait for an engineer to access the problem. Thank you, Timothy Richardson for your professional and prompt service."
"As a regular guest of our hotel, we are grateful that you enjoyed another stay at Sheraton Atlanta. We look forward to your DragonCon 2017 stay!"
Staff were excellent very helpful. Only drawback was we were not able to get 2 rooms side by side as expected. Internet and breakfast food items were of good quality. The exterior of the property would benefit from more lighting.
We're so very sorry to hear that your stay was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies.
"This hotel worked well for an overnight stay. Staff were pleasant and helpful , rooms fine with all extras you would expect ,and airport transport efficient. Breakfast included which we appreciated. 
Could recommend for this type of stay."
"This hotel is far prettier than what I expected. The service is also awesome, first class. I spent some days at the hotel for a conference and I think I should come back definitely for vacation in Atlanta."
"Great hotel, great staff!
While traveling to Atlanta on Business I had the pleasure to visit the Four Season's Atlanta.  Great hotel, great staff, nice rooms.  While in Atlanta I choose to stay no where else."
"Very nice hotel,staff very good,rooms very clean beds very comfortable,ideally located for area attractions and highways.Always use homewood suites when in usa as always welcoming and breakfast included every day as well as managers reception 5-7pm Monday to Thursday."
The staff is very helpful. The ambiance is nice and the rooms are comfortable. Thru and event there and it went well thanks to the staff. Stay here and you shouldn't be disappointed. Plus you are within walking distance of many cool spots.
"As is usual for this brand, clean rooms friendly staff, and nice onsite bistro for breakfast and dinner. Located in the business district a good choice to stay with some nice restaurants close by especially Bistro Niko!"
"Wonderful staff, clean rooms, lively free happy hour,  and Ruth Chris Steakhouse to top it off. Every one was extremely nice. Easy access to Centinial Olympic Park,  and many restaraunts nearby within walking distance. Near the AmeriMart."
I stayed at the Glenn while attending a conference at the GA World Congress Center. The proximity to the conference was very close. I enjoyed the front desk staff. My room while small was well appointed. I would definitely plan on staying here again.
We thank you very much for your good review and we are glad we could accommodate all your needs. Please return again soon.
"Stayed at the Mandarin Oriental this past weekend while in town for the Peachtree Road Race.  From the moment we arrived, everything was perfect!  The room was comfortable and the bathroom deserves a review by itself. Simply amazing."
Good hotel for price and location. This is my second time starting there. Just remember there is NO pool. Great location to Lenox Mall and shuttle service. Self parking is only 2.00 difference than the valet.
The hotel was more enjoyable than the excursions.  I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent relaxing on site.  The atmosphere was very elegant while remaining kid friendly. I look forward to my next Hyatt stay.
"The location was great for downtown attractions. It is right across the street for a MARTA stop. The staff was superb and very accommodating.  We will definitely stay there again, and we highly recommend it."
"Although i booked on the morning of my visit and with all the rooms occupied they still made room for me. Great ambience..staff were very welcoming. Great wifi too. The food was really nice if i must add that too. Overall, i'd come back again."
"Rooms were good, staff is friendly, location good except the park nearby can be sketchy ..just walk on the other side of the street. I've stayed here numerous times and it's always fine. Nice brewery next door too!"
The staff and facilities were fantastic. Every staff member I encountered was genuinely friendly and helpful. Came down late for breakfast and the gentleman that was in the restaurant offered to keep it open until my associates came down. Made me feel great. Thank you
Stayed here with my husband for an overnight (staycation).  We had a suite which was large and spacious...but is beginning to show a bit of wear and tear.  Please note: the staff is exceptional and the room was clean (just beginning to show its age).
"Pamela,  thank you for your post!  We are glad you enjoyed your visit and found our staff to be welcoming as well.  We look forward to welcoming you back again."
Very nice and clean room.  The staff is incredibly nice and helpful.  Will stay here again when I return for business and am looking forward to it.  Walkable distance from food and other downtown activities.
"Clean, beautiful rooms! Helpful, caring and efficient staff. Great location to the GA Aquarium and World of Coca Cola. Less than 7-8 minutes from parking garage to both places. Cool glass elevators and many wonderful staff members!"
Hotel Staff Amazing and JoAnne Richards was very professional and timely!!!  The hotel is in a great location and all services were delivered as promised.  I would highly reccommend this property for all needs!!!
Great location. Excellent service. Great food. The hotel was within walking distance of MARTA which I took from the Atlanta airport. It took about 30 minutes from the airport and the station is 2 blocks from the hotel. Very convenient!
"The rooms are very nice and well lit and appointed.  The staff is very helpful, polite and friendly.  The food is EXCELLENT.  I would stay here again on a personal trip for sure. The convention services were done well and the staff was great."
"Clean, nice rooms & good service but the breakfast could have been better. Not a lot of options, but the bagel was good.
They also have an ice cube machine that is a huge thumbsup! Super comfy beds, never slept better."
I always enjoy coming to Atlanta for our manager meetings and the shoe show. The reason I always enjoy coming to Atlanta is because I get to stay at the Wyndham. I truly love this hotel. Thank you again for a wonderful stay. Elizabeth
"Always been a pleasant stay at the Hyatt House Cobb Galleria. This was my 3rd time actually staying at this property. Very convient location, good breakfast, nice rooms. Will be returning in August for my birthday."
Room was nice but no fridge or microwave. like the staff but the location is horrible at night if you are going for dinner. Coffee bar isn't open long enough every day for those that like late afternoon coffee>
"helpful, friendly staff. quiet lovely facility.  The option of cooler outdoor pool and heated indoor pool was very nice.  Room was quiet and comfortable.   Breakfast had many options but a little overpriced. Food quality was excellent. Warm cookie at checkin delightful"
"The facility is in excellent condition, the room was ready , clean and well-ordered. The receptionist was efficient, cheerful, and very professional. I felt welcome and valued as a customer. Housekeeping also did an excellent job."
"Great suites, felt like I was renting a high end condo instead of a room. Staff friendly,  can't beat this in downtown Atlanta."
"Excellent room!  Staff was very friendly.  Only complaint, neighborhood was a little sketchy.  There isn't really anywhere you can walk to."
"Very nice place in a good location.  Excellent service, good food, helpful staff.  Good convention facilities.  Off-site parking was convenient but pricey.  Computerized check-in, check-out worked well.  Would stay there again."
"Noise was a big issue, both highway traffic and patrons in the hallway.  Rooms are large but not well maintained and didn't seem to be as clean as I would like. Bed was not comfortable.  Wouldn't return."
"This hotel is getting a 2 rating because the front desk staff was very friendly and the breakfast buffet looked very good.  My room gets a -1.  It was old, outdated, and dirty.  The bathroom floor had stains."
"Great Hotel! One of my favorites in Atlanta. Usually there are no issues with service. Parking is not the best, but that is expected in downtown Atlanta. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends."
Thx. so much for your comments. We have let our team know. So glad you enjoyed your stay in Buckhead! Hope you can come back soon!
"The hotel was very nice and the room was confortable and clean, Just the internet was not good, it was very unstable."
I am delighted to learn you enjoyed your stay and found the hotel to be exceptional.    The Atlanta skyline is truly beautiful and happy you had the opportunity to stay in one of our city view rooms.  We look forward to your return.
hotel very clean room better than expected pool was great tropical scene pool water salt based which im told is good staff very nice wanda at the cafe was great no game room surprised by that good location walking distance to arcade aquiriom coke factory
"Great location for business meetings.  In the heart of downtown. Near some great restaurants too. Walking distance to Coca-Cola, Aquarium, & Children's museums. If your family comes along for the business trip they have some things to see as well."
I had a great time staying at the Westin Atlanta. It was a very clean room with very good amenities. i would recommend anyone stay here for business or pleasure. They will be sure to love this site and the staff.
The marks I gave each category explains our experience.  We were greeted so by a delightful staff member at check in.  Breakfast was also satisfying and the housekeeping staff in the halls in the mornings greeted us well.
I want to say a special thanks to Ms.Jasmine for taking such great care of us and our students during our stay. Her hospitality and customer service is amazing. We definitely look forward to our next stay.
"We chose this hotel to stay for our 30th Wedding Anniversary. When my husband told the desk clerk this, the manager stepped over to her computer and gave us the Presidential Suite at no extra charge!!"
"The place was outstanding, the rooms were so nice...nice view, excellent staff and superb food. The court yard was nice, we attended a wedding there. The grass was beautiful. Oh yeah excellent bar staff !!"
We're so sorry your room experience was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlgh@hyatt.com to contact our managers about your stay.
My stay was nice but the bathroom wasnÃ¢ÂÂt clean. I would recommend this hotel to friends. My only complaint is the bathroom.
"Between walking and the use  of Marta, very accessible to many attractions, and restaurants.  Valet, on site parking at $40 a night didn't  make us feel like we  wanted to tip. Beautiful facility, nice pool and exercise  area."
"Excellent service throughout our stay. Everything was always well stocked and incredibly clean. Very comfortable room in the perfect location for our visit to Atlanta. We particularly enjoyed the pool, spa and gym!!"
"Happy New Year!

We're happy you stayed with us and that you enjoyed your visit!

We look forward to seeing to you again....and thank you in advance for recommending us!"
Stayed there overnight during a business trip.  Hotel seemed recently renovated and room was spacious and ultra modern.  Nice and clean as well. Lots of restaurants and shopping within walking distance although I did not have time to explore.Would definitely stay there again.
"A great location, near lots of restaurants. Walking distance from World of Coca Cola, Aquarium and the Georgia Dome. Comfortable rooms with wine tasting in the restaurant. The rooms could use a refrigerator though."
"Stayed for 2 nights to attend a wedding. Staff was nice and seemed competent but room had hot water issues, stayed hot despite dropping air to mid 60s.  Room was not serviced until 3 pm
There are better choices"
"The staff is top of the charts and they go out of your way to make you feel like this is where you belong. The place is clean and the amenities are outstanding. Great hot tub, and pool. Much more than adequate fitness room."
Staff was very accommodating and friendly. They honestly seemed to want to make our stay there a pleasant one. Rooms are nice and quiet. Location is outstanding if you plan on doing some shopping at Lenox or Phipps.
"Amenities were nice, bed was comfortable, and room was roomy.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Drinks were limited but food was acceptable.  Eating area was cramped, and temperature was a little balmy.  I would stay there again on business."
"We stayed the night before flying out early. Great experience... good dinner, great room, wonderful employees!! We also used the hotel shuttle and parked our car there during our trip. I would refer to anyone!"
"Our family stayed here and our toddler had a medical emergency during our stay. The response and concern by this staff was outstanding. David, the security guard, was particularly helpful and caring during this stressful event and we are forever grateful."
"Nice residence that feels cozy like being in a big family house. Good service and nice people. Also Chef DarylÃ¢ÂÂs food is just AMAZING!!
The chicken wings are sooo yummy and the oven potatoes are FINGERLICKING good!! You have to try for yourself"
"This is a great hotel with awesome front desk people.
I had the buffet breakfast about 9:00 am and it was a little old !  The rooms are second to none...great location and great hotel.  The rooms are quite nice."
Embassy Suites in Buckhead is wonderful!  I've stayed here 3 times and each time I have experienced Great service.  The front desk is great! I especially enjoy the managers cocktail and snack time as well as the made to order breakfast!
"Unfortunately due a problem with the hotel was having with a water problem, there were equipment obstacles on my 
floor, a lot of noise and a unpleasant smell."
"Hotel was in a great location, close to all the Atlanta attractions. Staff were all very helpful and friendly, but the main selling point of this hotel In our opinion was the Sky Lounge. The view from here was amazing."
"Very nice concierge and the staff here is amazing. We are very impressed with the cleanliness and the assertive attention of the staff when questions are asked. Service is excellent, food is great and rooms are very impressive"
"Such an amazingly sweet staff! A great little place. Loving the fire-side courtyard. Enjoying our stay very much. Our rooms were very comfortable, and very clean. I would definitely come back  and visit. Valet is available for your vehicle, if needed. (No self parking)"
"The service and staff on this hotel were excellent! Rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff are friendly & very helpful. Food at the bistro was excellent. Parking was convenient! Prices were a little high in convenient store on location! 
Would recommend!"
I refuse to devote any additional time to this location based on the customer service from housekeeping. Don't waste your time or money. Choose another hotel. I will not be coming back to this location ever!
"A great hotel in a great location. A short walk to famous Ford Theater. Easy walk to Italian cuisine and Southern homestyle cooking.
Hotel staff was very accomodating and check in was quick and easy.
Afternoon snacks with beer and wine helps a person unwind."
Room should have never been rented. Sink wouldn't drain. No wear to hang clothes except hangers on door knobs. No lighting above sink. Shower only had very hot water no cold water. Wall striping still had tape to hold it on.
Not happy for the first time at this location. Noisy room and up all night. Reported and the only thing offered was another room for two additional hours. Front desk was unbothered and lacked concerned
Great for the price and location.  Employees were friendly and noise was quiet. The location was convenient as it is close to several locations and the MARTA system. . Food was great. I will give it a thumbs up.
"Cute hotel, friendly front desk staff, has potential but my room was filthy.  Dust, toenail clippings, hair.  Disgusting. There was also an awful smell of body odor coming from the bathroom.  This hotel needs a major deep cleaning."
"Very cozy suite, nicely decorated, good treadmills in the work out room. Good location, easy success from interstate, staff were very accommodating and friendly. The breakfast looked and smelled great. Room service available. The room had every thing you could need and more."
"Good hotel convent friendly staff I have no complaints. I would stay there again very affordable. Rooms are average size, but clean. The area is in a good part of Atlanta fast food places are 5 minutes away."
There is NO EXCUSE for not getting but one coffee Into a room. Worse is the follow up from Marriott on their app that provoked a response from me when there was NO ONE AVAILABLE to address my concerns. This is inexcusable.
"Great bar tender,breakfast service personnel and driver.  Went out of their way to make us feel welcomed.  Front desk service was dismal.  

Near the park so perfect location for a trip to watch a Braves game.  

Rooms are clean and food is good."
"Thx. so much for your review. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. We'll let our team know. Hope you'll stay with us again, soon!"
Great place to stay my kids enjoyed the pool and hot tub .glad they stayed open until 10:00pm .Excellent customer service From begin to the End. Definitely would Recommend so kid friendly. Looking forward to staying here again.
"Came here about 4 years ago and the visit was ok.   This time was so much better.   Rooms were remodeled but what makes it 5 star was the people.   The staff was top class, friendly, and very helpful.   Would stay again."
Everything was perfect. Ony Danchimah Thank You so much. Marcus up at the Garden Bar. Thank You so much. Can't wait to go back to Atlanta. Will definitely stay there again as well as recommend to others.
"Lovely environment, kind and attentive staff, service completely on point. Had a high energy business meeting series.  My rest at the Ritz Carleton Buckhead was the perfect respite to relax, rest, and reenergize between long days."
"Was in town for a conference and this was the hotel.  I was pleasantly surprise by the hotels decor, quality, service and food.  It wasn't a Four Seasons but for the price point I think the hotel was excellent."
"For this type of hotel, you would expect a continental breakfast, or at the very least maybe coffee,juice,bagel or pastry in the morning.  Almost all other hotels in this price range do this for their guests.  the bed was comfortable, and the room was clean."
The Front Desk staff was awesome especially Jamillah forgive me if spelling is wrong. She was very courteous and polite on the phone as well in person.  She was very welcoming and professional. I will definitely recommend thos property
We were driving back from Disney and needed a comfortable place to stay. Our expectations were more than exceeded by the customer service Royce showed us!! We felt like family and we felt genuinely valued as guests.
"I stayed in the Hyatt for 4 nights and I can really recommend it. They have nice and modern rooms and a beautiful lobby. 

Apart from that, the service was perfect, especially Elijah helped me a lot to get all my bags to my room."
"Arrived At the front desk the check in associate was friendly, prompt, and professional. We was quickly checked in without delay. The room was clean and neat with air condition already set. The pool room and workout center was great also."
"Stayed one night for business.  Staff was friendly and room was clean. I was a little skeptical after I read some of the less than stellar reviews, but took and chance and it paid off big time! Loved the swank furniture and atmosphere"
"Located right near the Atlanta airport, this hotel was outstanding.  The nightly managers reception was better than other Embassy Suites I have stayed at.  The breakfast was of course excellent.  Although it was near the airport, there was hardly any airplane noise to be heard."
Great updated rooms and excellent service. The location is not really convenient to ATL sites however its still a great value.
Good except for check in. Gave me a pretty hard time about it employee voucher form. Did not appear the staff thought I was a Wyndham employee
"Great customer service from Matthew. Enjoyed my stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Atlanta, Ga. Great Complementary breakfast. Can get to all parts of downtown Atlanta without to muck of a problem."
The room was clean and quiet.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  Room service was prompt as promised.  The location was excellent near many attractions.  It would have been nice to have a store in the hotel to pick up small items.
"Great staff, location, super clean and modern! Across from Hard Rock Cafe, ask about the red phone booth just around the corner! Had a great stay! Would highly recommend! Parking is valet only at $38 per night plus tip. No fridge or microwave though."
Looking forward to more opportunities to stay at this beautiful hotel.  Everything was perfect.  We were a very large group and everything went smoothly and professionally. I can't say enough great things about this stay.
Second time staying here. Walking distance to lots of museums and centennial park. Very fancy hotel from the lobby to individual unique rooms. Very comfortable beds and pillows. Staff is very friendly. IÃ¢ÂÂll be back!
Hotel is EXCELLENT!  Stayed in a suite.  The only drawback is the shower.  The shower was just TOO TOO SMALL!!!!!  The hotel and the staff were excellent.  We stayed in a suite which was absolutely wonderful.
Four Seasons is conveniently located near the Emory campus and great restaurants within walking distance.  Service was great.  Room was excellent.  Love the gym.  Fun hanging out in the bar.  This is my go to Atlanta hotel.
"We had to carry our own luggage AL the way around the perimeter of the building.  There was no cart and no offer was made to assist us.  Tough for seniors.  Room decor old.  Tiny TV, but bed was very good."
"Wonderful staff, very clean.  Rooftop bar and restaurant are excellent.  I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.  The SPG recognition and 4 PM late checkout was excellent as well.  The amenities of this hotel are better than any hotel in the area."
"I've been staying here for years, and whoever is managing this property needs to be relocated to Siberia. Inattentive staff, room service and restaurant suffer from the same. Outdated and dirty. I'm done."
"This was our first time at the Artmore and it was fabulous!  All the employees, but especially Alicia at the Front Desk, were friendly and attentive.  The hotel offers such character.  Great location too."
"Room was dirty, old decor and had a musty smell. This hotel isn't worth $150 per night. Double Tree needs to remodel ASAP. This has been the worst Double Tree I've ever encountered.  Staff was very helpful and friendly."
"Lovely Hotel, friendly staff, clean rooms, bathroom is tiny but it served its purpose, no complaints for us. Great location for Fox theatre and for walking around. Wish we had stayed in this one at beginning of our journey."
"Hotel is clean and comfortable.  The breakfast is pretty good and the free cookies at check in are a very nice plus!  For us, the location is perfect with easy access to downtown and other areas in ATL."
"Great place to stay, friendly staff, clean hotel and great location. Front desk check-in was a great experience felt very welcomed by staff. Walking distance to lots of restaurants. Will definitely stay here again."
Very Friendly Staff and a desire to be helpful! Rooms were always cleaned in a timely and predictable manner. Great conference space and cool connection to Peachtree Food Court and trains. Hotel bar drinks and food quality was a pleasant find!
"This hotel has free hot breakfast, free parking, good gym and pool. Most rooms have king size beds. Has kitchen and flat screen that rotate from bed room to sitting area.It also has a small bar, and location is close to shopping areas.Very friendly staff."
This hotel was clean and refreshing from all the others i had stayed at. The staff was perfect. They ware hospitable and the room was exactly what i needed. The gym was well equipped and the pool was perfect.
"Minimum number of towels provided. If you use one, you had to request more because there was only one set of towels.  The quality of the breakfast was less than what I had previously experienced.  The evening snacks were stale"
We thank you for your good review of our hotel and are looking forward to seeing you again on your next trip our way.
"Hotel is a bit dated, but fine for an airport stay.  Breakfast was good.  Check-in associate was having a coughing attack when I checked in which didn't start off on a good foot.  Also, this hotel charges $12 for parking."
The complimentary breakfast was nice to have. Our room was very cold and drafty. There was a horrible smell by the elevator that was there our entire visit
"My husband and I went to Atlanta this past weekend. We had a wonderful experience. Walking distance to the park, room, bed and staff were great! There was no other hotel closer to Suntrust Park. Definitely stay here again."
The Georgian Terrace is a Gem.  It is conveniently located in the heart of the city.  The staff is amazing.  The best part of this Gem is the rooftop lounge type pool area and the panoramic views it offers.
Fresh carpet and new decor is gorgeous! Bedrooms are largely quiet. Living room area rather loud due to the hall noise. Overall it was clean and the staff were helpful. I recommend staying on higher floors to decrease the noise levels.
Homewood Inn and Suits sets the standard for the hotel industry.  The staff ensured the stay would be a memorable one. They exceeded our expectations. Homewood offers a very inviting atmosphere. My family enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend Homewood.
"Rooftop bar, with awesome views. Cool kinetic art on the roof that move with the wind.  Sweet lobby with very chic furnishings, and a very cool lighting fixture. Room and bed were nice. Staff was very friendly, and helpful."
Had a great experience a the Sheraton Hotel downtown Atl thanks to Jeffery Kinne I felt like he own the place great customer service everything done at a timley fashion would recommend anybody here. Thanks :)
"Booked a room last minute for the Braves Game/Concert, it was only a $5.Uber ride to game. Conveniently located near many attractions. Must Valet park, no other parking available, rooms were clean and bed was comfortable."
The lobby was fresh and inviting and the front desk staff efficient.  My room was well decorated and the bathroom practically sparkled.  Who could complain about that?  Everything seemed brand new.  The breakfast was served quickly and the quality of food was good.
"The Valet Parking, restaurants, bars, lounges, grounds, and rooms were spacious, clean, and laid back. It's rare to find an entire package of both professional and cool individuals. There was massive construction next door yet we didn't hear a thing."
My husband and I stayed here New Years Eve for a post baby moon.  The team here could not have been more accommodating. I 500% recommend asking for Carlos when you book.  To have him take care of ALL your details. He is the best!
This hotel is a very good value.  Rooms are clean.  Shower pressure is good.  Free wifi worked fine.  I found the staff to be very helpful.  They have a free shuttle that will transport guests anywhere within 2 miles.  I would stay here again.
"The overall hotel experience was awesome. I enjoyed the courteous staff and the breakfast was very good. The only thing I didnÃ¢ÂÂt like was the parking, I arrived late night and there was no parking spots available so I had to park very far."
"Many thanks for sharing your wondrous experience with us!
We are so glad to hear that your children felt like royalty on their first stay with us!
We Looking forward to welcoming you and your family back to Mandarin Oriental Atlanta for your next visit!"
"Walking distance from midtown metro station, so it's very easy to get downtown and to the airport.  Good restaurants close by (Steamhouse & Ecco) and it's also close to GTech.  Rooms are clean and the service was excellent."
"Very friendly service from the host ""Rosemary"" in the restaurant in the morning! Thank You Rosemary! Mike the shuttle driver was very helpful in assisting the team in scheduling places to visit in the evenings. Our company associates had a very enjoyable week!!"
"Customer service was not up to par. We could here the people in the next room. The ladies at the front desk wasnÃ¢ÂÂt to friendly, no eye contact with me, which I felt was rude. I had to say hello how are you."
Very friendly staff. The breakfast was amazing and loved the room and the bed was very comfortable.  Very close to Georgia Tech and right next to The Varsity.  Would stay here again next time in Atlanta.
"The Hyatt Place Atlanta Airport North is in a great location near the airport, it was clean and the service was amazing.  Free shuttle to/ from the airport and complimentary breakfast was a nice touch.  We were here visiting friends and enjoyed a great stay!"
"The hotel is extremely clean, quite and accessible. We stayed just one night for a wedding. Friendly staff and I was asked several times if they could help in any way. We throughly enjoyed our stay. The bed and bath did not disappoint."
"Great Experience!!! Clean, Well maintained and had a great experience in Season's for dinner-hostess and server were fantastic!!!!!  Great location with shuttle pick up from ATL.  Room was quiet and good size."
"hanks and we appreciate your great review, thanks for noticing as we aspire to save water, glad the Hosts at out hotel took excellent care of you. Please come back again and thank you for traveling ."
"Big rooms. Well cleaned but outdated. Staff was very nice.  Bar and restaurant were OK but there are far better ones near. A good business hotel if you need be in the area.  Concierge was knowledgeable and helpful finding restaurants , bars and sightseeing."
Incorrect charges on my bill.Horrible service.Check in and check out total disaster.I will not recommend Hyatt regency Atlanta.I filed a dispute with American Express regarding the hotelÃ¢ÂÂs billing.Terrible experience with Hyatt Regency Atlanta.
"I have stayed at this hotel several times and it is always a pleasure.  It is very near the airport, perfect for an early morning flight.  Their shuttle is great.  I also like their onsite restaurant which makes dinner really easy."
We are glad to read you had a perfect stay here at the Embassy Suites Hotel Atlanta Airport. Thank  you for such a nice review.
The interior is very inviting. The staff are friendly and well trained. Our room was lovely and the beds were extremely comfy. Only thing was the air freshener in the elevator.....yuck.  All else was very good.
"Overall stay was very good. A little bit of noise right next to elevators by people getting on and off. The meeting rooms were nice. Tried to pack too many chairs at each table, no elbow room, but I guess it saved on costs."
Very nice stay. A million maids keeping the place clean. Breakfast is awesome! Anna is the late night clerk and could not be more friendly! Great staff in general! Weekends are a little busy but the hotel is big and spread out. Nice stay!
"Good location , close to airport downtown and midtown ,a lot of food options in the area, room should have microwaves. The carpet was stained which it should have been cleaned before checking someone in . Overall nice staff and room"
"Nickole, the manager is exceptional and the staff including katya, and matthew are awesome. My stay at this hotel was very satisfying, and relaxing. The room was very clean and supplied with everything I needed."
I like this stay it was nice but not to clean i had stuff on my floor when i arrive but threw it all i had a goos time
This was the second time. The first was a little better. The hotel is nice. Location is great but the housekeeping this time was not as good. I asked to see if I got the best price and no one wanted to help me.
"We held a large Company meeting at this hotel.  We had great service from the banquet team.  The staff that were the most helpful were Rick, Whitney, David, Teresa, and Ralph.  Other banquet staff were also very helpful I just didn't catch their names."
"This is a wonderful hotel. The staff is very courteous and helpful to guests. The cost was very reasonable. The only thing that I disliked was being on the side near the interstate. However, I will definitely stay here again."
I was very happy with my stay. I have told many people that if they have to go to Atlanta to stay at this hotel it was very nice.
This is a excellent place to stay if you are in town to catch a Braves games.  Close to the ball park and within walking distance.  Very clean and friendly.  Will stay here again soon! They also give military discount and free parking.
"Convenient, affordable, everything you want in a stay away from home!  Everything about the place shouted Welcome!  I would not hesitate to stay here again.  It will be my go to place in Atlanta! Great job Hyatt!"
"Corner king room, quiet and comfortable. Eric, the concierge, was a peach! He hooked us up with Uber and area eats. Walk to the subway station and lots of restaurants. Stay. You will not be disappointed."
Frequent traveler for sports and this hotel and staff surpassed expectations starting at check in.  Stephanie  was on top of check in and had all rooms keyed by team when we arrived.  All of the staff was super friendly and welcoming.
"We stayed here for a conference, and used the Marta trains to get around. Very quiet and brand new hotel with valet parking. Free coffee, but breakfast costs. Two blocks from Marta trains. Within walking distance to Piedmont park and Georgia Tech University."
"Good location, clean rooms, courteous staff, reasonable price.
Had no problems and required no assistance however staff was available and visible.
Coffee in lobby every morning was a nice perk.
Water was hot with good pressure, room amenities were well stocked."
I would stay here again and again it was a great place. The location was great and convenient for a trade show at The Cobb Galleria.  I felt very comfortable there. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone who likes modern accommodations
"Friendly staff, very comfy beds, clean rooms, nice little lobby store for snacks and drinks. Didn't get to use bar cuz it closed before my group returned from a concert. Definitely would stay in this hotel for future trips to the Atlanta area."
"Breakfast was included in my $200 a night pkg, at the end of my 7 day stay and after tipping the servers each morning, I got hit for an 18% gratuity automatically added to my final bill for each day that I ate breakfast."
"Love this hotel!  From the minute you arrive the staff treats you like family. Upgraded to the club level and so glad I did- the amenities in the club area are amazing. Hot breakfast, full bar, just perfect."
"We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to write such wonderful things about our hotel.  It appears you had a great time with us and we are thankful for your kind words and your business.  We hope to see you again soon!

Warmest Regards,"
"There is a real need for the Hotel to review the breakfast buffet. Hot food choice is poor. Cold and plastic like scrambled eggs each morning, mass produced and left to spoil. Omelettes over cooked and closer to resembling burritos."
"The staff was professional and welcoming. Hotel decor , the restaurant and the rooms were fabulous. Perfect location across from Lenox Mall and Phipps Mall. Love my stay and would go back next trip. Great place to stay much better choice than the Marriott Marquis."
"What a wonderful review of the Atlanta Marriott Buckhead Hotel & Conference Center, thank you.  We couldnÃ¢ÂÂt be happier knowing that you enjoyed everything about your stay with us.

Best regards,

General Manager"
Enjoyed our stay.  Staff was excellent.  Music playing in lobby and in eating/bar area was great.  Food was excellent for both breakfast and dinner.  Breakfast buffet is an excellent value. Rooms are a little on the small side but quality of beds is excellent.
I spent 3 night here for work. Staff was very courteous and pleasant to deal with. They accommodated our large group very well. The hotel and rooms have great devpr and are very clean. Great 3 days and a wonderful place to stay.
My experience was very positive. The running theme among all employees I worked with was Kindness. Everyone had a sincere desire to make my stay enjoyable. 5 stars to HR that does the hiring.  Well done.
"This hotel has it all.  Centrally located in the great Buckhead area of Atlanta and super convenient to GA 400.  Great ambiance, very relaxing bar, and phenomenal Zen garden.  Great value.  Quiet rooms. Great shuttle service within a 2 mile radius.  Shuttle driver is awesome!"
"The air conditioning in the hotel was not working, and they knew it was not working when the reservations were made but did not inform me.  My room was 80ÃÂ° when I checked in, I never got below 78 all night. Terrible experience."
"Had a good experience here. Nothing particularly stood out either good or bad. Everyone was polite, parking onsite wasn't too much of a hassle, and the beds were pretty comfortable. Would stay here again."
"Amazing hotel with a caring staff, lovely rooms, great food, and a relaxing spa. The place is intimate and attracts an upscale crowd. Excellent choice! Try it once and you will never stay at another Buckhead hotel again."
"Very disappointed in this hotel. Expected a lot more from an embassy suites. Green ring around tub drain, uncomfortable spring beds, curtains ripped, AC was out in guest rooms but not in the lobby. Valet attendants rude"
We're so glad you enjoyed your time with us - please come see us again soon!
"We were in town for a concert and was amazed at the hotel we got for the price we paid!  The staff was pleasant and welcoming, the food was great and the room was comfy!  My husband and I were very pleased."
One our favorite places to stay in Atlanta. Architecture in the Frank Lloyd Wright style. Not fancy but very comfortable.  Near Emory University and convenient to Atlanta locations. Set in a wooded location. Come and relax.
"Very large rooms and very nice people.  Free parking provided in garage, which is great for Downtown Atlanta.  Convention rates were very reasonable.  Would stay there again next year if convention is in same place."
"Room has no microwave,  does have mini fridge. Large rooms. Room service available. Choose bed and breakfast package, so you'll have the very good full breakfast. Good location near Cobb Galleria and Cumberland Mall. They have free shuttle within 5 miles for shopping and restaurants."
Very relaxing and close to the airport. Service was execellent and friendly.  Rooms were very large and well kept.  Would diff stay here again for my next trip to Atlanta.  Breakfast omelet was perfect and good variety.
A Loft Hotel in Atlanta is a nice Hotel in the heart of Atlanta. Rather in town for business or for leisure this Hotel offers great service and accomadtions to fit your need. IÃ¢ÂÂd recommend A Loft in Atlanta to all. Check them out!
we were thrilled with the service and proximity to centennial park .parked the car on Friday and didn't get back in till Monday. Right around the corner is Corner bakery with breakfast all day - CVS 1 block more.
Beautiful setting - love the gardens in the back.  Rooms are decorated very beautifully.  And the staff is the friendliest that I've ever encountered (by far) at any hotel. I recommend checking out this hotel if in Atlanta.
"There were creepy millipedes in the bathroom which I barely used. The room was right next to the exit, so the door slammed day and night. I'll never stay here again with it's cryptic floor plan and directions to the room."
"My stay at this facility was short, and therefore my review is brief.  My only complaint would be about the bathroom. It was a bit small.  However, beds were comfortable, room smelled nice and staff provided exceptional service."
"Had a great experience at the Whitley while visiting Atlanta / Buckhead on business. The service was efficient, discrete and very friendly. The food exceptional (you have to try the octopus!!!). Will definitely be back.  Thank you."
Meeting hotel close to Atlanta airport and easy walk to restaurants   Rooms were clean and service was ok.  The hotel does have some renovations so fitness center was closed.  Nice meeting rooms and banquet service.
"The hotel is a little old, door handle turned the opposite way that it normally does, one of the cabinet door was about to fall apart, other than that it was a great stay, very quiet and comfy stay, would def recommend the hilton service."
"This hotel is just the best. It is spotless and the customer service is superb. They truly exceeded my expectations. The pool was lovely and the sauna was relaxing. The restaurant was great as well.
We will return to this hotel."
"Terrible hotel.  Room was moldy especially in the shower area. Hallway wall plaster cracked and missing in places.  Very noisy, almost no sound proofing between rooms.   The restaurant offers a buffet for 15 dollars.  Does not include coffee.  Definitely not worth it."
"Located in the ""burbs"" of Atlanta it is cozy and has a friendly atmosphere. Beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, well mannered and a wonderful breakfast brunch. The room was as comfortable as being at home."
I appreciate you sharing your experience with others.  We look forward to having you back with us again soon.
"The Emory conference center hotel was the perfect location for the Emory STEM symposium. The pool and fitness center were amazing, but the greenery around the hotel made the stay very pleasant. The staff were extremely helpful for getting around the symposium too!"
Stay was great. Staff was very friendly. Amenities make the cost well worth it. Good restaurants in walking distance. All of my stats have been great. Free breakfast and the evening social make the cost seem minimal as well. I'll be back!!
"Our room was beautiful and very comfortable, as expected at the Four Seasons.  What made our stay so very nice was the friendly and accommodating staff . . . really providing that Southern Hospitality!"
"The staff here is phenomenal. Always so attentive and greets you as you walk through the door. Room was very nice, large, full kitchen and living room. Excellent value and location. Will stay here again."
"Very clean and family friendly. Breakfast had a good selection, pool was nice, rooms clean and quiet. The staff was dry nice and helpful. Right next to interstate so it makes it easy to get around in a timely fashion"
Michelle was very pleasant she had a very speedy check in with a smile on her face.  I appreciate good service and do not write these reviews on a regular basis but i give 5 stars to the service we received.
Prefect location and best everything. I loved my hotel room and the breakfast was amazing.  2 hours of complimentary drinks and snacks for guests.  The atmosphere is so relaxing and Ruth Chris and Starbucks or in the lobbying.
The staff here are very nice and accommodating.  The rooms are nice sized.  The indoor pool is a saltwater pool and is amazing!  This is our go-to hotel when we do anything in the Atlanta area.  It is close to many great restaurants and shopping.
No Car and sick :-(. Needed to run errands and had to use hotel transport. Lilly was so sweet and helpful in helping me get everything done quickly and efficiently so I was able to get back to bed. Truly kind and sweet..
The Hyatt Atlanta Midtown is centrally located right next to awesome restaurants and the Botanical garden. It's a short taxi ride to all of the tourist attractions. Room was spacious enough to work remotely and be productive!
"Friendly staff, room decor a bit tired.
Convenient location. The Bar is old school and great if you like Whiskey.
Everything worked in the room.
The place works but a bit dull. I could not find anything wrong it is just a bit uninspiring."
"Great room,really quiet.Staff is very nice and helpful.Very good bar with  views of the city.Our place to stay in ATL.Waling distance to the dome and restaurants.CNN center in in the building ,Great for kids and the College football hall of fame is next door."
The rooms and beds are very comfortable. The staff are also quite helpful. The presence of restaurants and a grocery store at Emory Point within walking distance make staying there a lots more convenient.
"We always enjoy hearing from  our return guests and would like to thank you for
posting such a pleasant review. Please return the next time you are in our area."
"My family and I wanted to stay in a family oriented hotel. Shalise gave us a great welcome! My daughter  enjoy very much the pool.  My husband and I had a wonderful time at the restaurant Fandangles, good food and great view!"
Shakil was so kind and helped us to get the TV working so we could rest comfortably while waiting for our room to be ready.  He even went out of his way to find the right remote control and let us choose the channel.
"The hotel is very nice,. Our room was on the 61st floor which provided an excellent view. The hotel location is ideal because of its proximity to many restaurants and places of interest. I would definitely stay there again."
"Enjoyed everything about the hotel. My room was very nice. The view was amazing. The hotel staff was very friendly and very helpful. The location was awesome, right in the middle of tourist locations and bars."
"This is a new Buckhead property across from the Phipps Place Mall, a short walk via a pedestrian friendly walkway. The hotel is stylish, trendy, and a cool scene. Underground parking is a plus. Rooms are sleek and efficient for any traveler."
"Nice price, I honestly didnÃ¢ÂÂt mind the valet price ($45)because the room price was so reasonable for a nice hotel. One down side was how long the valet took to allow us to pull in and how long it took to retrieve the car."
"This was a great find. Right in the middle of everything that you really want to do in Atlanta. Shopping, food, fun and entertainment. Cozy and comfortable rooms, great hospitality and friendly staff."
"The rooms were nice in this hotel and itÃ¢ÂÂs conveniently located downtown.  However, the hotel was noisy, the restaurant wasnÃ¢ÂÂt very good and my friends had their computers stolen during our conference."
"Valets are super nice and took time to recommend local places to eat. Loved them! Check in was very welcoming and quick. Room was extremely nice, clean, modern, with a nice view. Conveniently located to  so much in downtown Atlanta, including Marta."
"This airport hotel has a great location, friendly staff and is very clean.  The rooms are well insulated. You truly don't hear hall noise or even folks in the next room.  It is connected to the conference center and I would highly recommend staying here."
We're so glad we could be part of your special weekend!  Come back and see us again soon ... perhaps on every anniversary!  :)
I'm glad we were able to accomodate your schedule on your departure day - come see us again soon!
Had a great stay and will stay again soon - I recommend to colleagues to stay here when they need to be in Atlanta.  This was my second stay and it improved this time over the last which was very good as well.
"Besides being a very handy hotel for business and travel lay-overs, it is clean and updated.  Difficulties with a late arrival were pleasantly and professionally handled by Ralph  - the house engineer and William Clark - the host of the executive lounge."
"Comfortable, convenient hotel. Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. Could use improvement in insuring all items are functional. Some furniture and appliances didn't work or were broken. Rooms very nicely finished, but some areas awkwardly arranged. Need to clean a little better, though not unacceptable."
"The room was wonderful and clean.  The overlook of the area was magnificent, even at night.  Very quiet and anything that I needed I received an answer.  Thanks for also having a Starbucks Coffee on site.  The attendant was a very nice young lady."
"Thx. so much for your comments. We love our salads, and our Japanese Zen Garden! Glad you were able to enjoy. Hope you'll stay with us again, soon!"
I went as part of a business conference and was pleasantly surprised and the depth and breadth of the location and the services. Food at both the restaurant and the bar were well worth it.  It was also well situated downtown.
This hotel has great customer service.  They allowed early check in at noon.  Made sure room was completely satisfactory.  Room was very clean and they gave us a suite for the same price.  Everyone was friendly
As always this location goes well above and beyond to make sure that you have a wonderful experience and to make sure that you will want to return. The staff here truly cares about the guests and it shows.
"We thoroughly appreciate the spectacular review! Our valet service is awesome and we are also pleased to offer self-parking to our guests. Next time, we hope you will stay with us the entire time in Atlanta. Safe travels!"
"Worst booking experience and hotel stay I have ever experienced. The location was great and the hotel was clean, however, they are rude and not accommodating. I wouldn't recommend to anyone honestly. Be careful"
"The hotel is new and the staff were very helpful. It just that it's a bit expensive especially with parking fee. The valet fetch the car without much waiting. But the location is very good, very close to MARTA, grocery store and GaTech."
Every staff member I encountered at this hotel was exceptional.  I was there for a trade show and everything was great with the hotel. The rooms were clean and size of room was great.  Love having a refrigerator in all the rooms.
It makes sense why they are renovating. Hotel outdated and sheets were dirty. Had to change rooms. Housekeeping did a terrible job.  Breakfast was decent. Pay to park which makes no sense. Just add it to the cost of the room.
Stay at the Grand Hyatt was great. Room was very clean and the staff was very attentive. Restaurants near nearby served great dishes.  Its around a 5-7 min walk to the Marta Transit. Would definitely stay here again.
The hotel was quiet and conveniently located off the interstate.The staff was friendly and helpful. The shuttle service to the nearby mall was very efficient. The outside area for hosting wedding receptions was very pretty.
Wonderful hotel for business or pleasure. Friendly staff that really go out of their way to make your experience great. Thank you Ellis hotel for a short but enjoyable mini-vacation while i was there for work.
"This is a very nice, and very clean hotel.  Front service was excellent and the entire staff was courteous and friendly.  Our room was spacious.  This Buckhead hotel is in a great location as it is connected to the Lenox Mall."
"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your time with us during the PAW convention. We loved hosting your group! Thx. so much for your comments, and for being our guest. Please come back again, soon!"
"Beautiful place! Very professional. I will definitely stay here again. Checking in and out was so easy. Nice staff. The food was great and reasonably. Love the color theme, and design. This place is so great next to a great area."
"Here for a business conference, great room,loved the balcony. wonderful staff all the way around. What a great location, suited our needs. I WOULD stay here again !! The reception food was outta this world fantastic."
"Room was not cleaned properly daily (hair left on bathroom floor for days and other trash, floor sticky). We sometimes had no face towels or hand towels. The hotel was extremely noisy at night.  However, the staff was courteous."
My room had dirty sheets and pillow covers the last night I stayed there and when I asked the lady she said the room and sheets were just changed which was clearly not the case.  It was disappointing cause I do stay there a lot
They have a great respectful staff and the rooms were amazing I will stay there again during my many trips to Atlanta
"Enjoyed a mid week stay.  I had read many, many reviews; and they basically rang true.  Nice location, great views, awkward valet parking, the place reeked of weed getting off the elevator, and the rooms need updating."
"We're so glad we could be of service during your stay. Thx. so much for being our guest. We hope you can stay with us again, soon!"
"Traffic and valet were extremely backed up.
Older building and rooms that need to be updated.
Room still had pretzels on the floor from previous guests.
Beds are not comfortable they are cheap and hard.
Great views and location"
"The Hyatt Place Atlanta was wonderful! Every single interaction with a staff member was a positive one. I would 100% recommend this location to anyone visiting Atlanta. It was clean, in a great location, and affordable."
"Great hotel for an overnight stay before a trip.  Using the sky train
from the airport is so convenient.  We have stayed at this Mariott
3 times now and just love it. The staff are all so pleasant and helpful."
"We visited Atlanta for the opening of the Mercedes Benz Stadium. Our visit was also to take in  the NFL game between the Atlanta Falcons and the Green Bay Packers. Unfortunately for us, Green Bay fans, the Falcons were the better team that night."
Hotel is well worth every penny. Room was small but clean and staff was very friendly. They gave me some good suggestion for my spare time after work. Restaurant and bar is also good and clean and food was ok
"By far the nicest Hyatt property we have ever seen.  Great staff, valet, concierge, everyone!  Check in was simple, check out even more simple! Valet was quick simple and easy. Entire property wS beautiful!!!"
"Every aspect of my stay was amazing.  From Check-in, bell staff, concierge, restaurant and Lounge were all amazing.  You will be pampered and spoiled throughout your stay.  If you need anything, just ask and you shall receive."
"My best friend and I stayed at the Doubletree for a girl's weekend.  The hotel was very nice, clean, convenient to many things and just a short drive to downtown.  Staff was very friendly.  We would stay again."
"Loved the history of hotel and retro style rooms. staff was very friendly. restaraunt was also good. Its was so cold outside that I coudl have used a heavier comforter, but besides that it was a gfreat stay!"
I had a wonderful experience while staying there.  The room was perfect and there it had the best view in all of Atlanta! The service was impeccable as well! I will definitely recommend the Westin to all of my friends and family.
"Booked this hotel so that I could catch the Cavs vs. Hawks game. Greeted very well, acknowledged my Marriott status, very hospitable. Nice clean and comfortable rooms with great location. This is definitely one of the nicest Residence Inn I have stayed at."
"Located across street from aquarium, park and coca cola museum. Great location. Roof top hot tub was great after walking all day. Indoor pool and work out room as well. Room is large and comfortable. Ours was overlooking the city.Awesome"
"I was in town for a funeral. Everyone at the hotelÃ¢ÂÂdesk clerk, valet, shuttle driver, restaurant staffÃ¢ÂÂprovided superior, friendly service. I had everything I needed for a comfortable and comforting stay.  Thank you, Double Tree."
"We absolutely Loved everything about this place !!!!!! Very friendly staff .. rooms were  clean ... and the beds were awesome !!!!!! I really enjoyed my stay and will be back soon. 
Thanks for the great customer service!!!!!!!!!"
"Huge lobby area- great for groups. Room was large, clean and upscale.  Comfy bed and pillows. Free Shuttle from airport.

I was only there for one night, but would recommend.

Restaurant and Marriott Elite lounge on site."
"Great place to stay. Easy uber ride to the  downtown ATL. Conference rooms were very clean, the grounds are very nice. I would definitely stay again. Hotel food and bar are also very tasty and affordable."
They never responded to issues until manager was contacted through corporate. Asked 5 times and forced to deal with non functional toilet in a hot room. All this made worse by the face this was upgrade
We were given a brand new room on the top floor. Great stay. Food in hotel was really good and the bar is open late. Construction going on was not a problem and they have a nice little outdoor pool bar area.
"We are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay, please come again, thanks for traveling"
"Convenient to airport, restful, clean, good food for breakfast and evening 'dinner' and cocktail hour (all complimentary).
Free shuttle to airport if you need it.
Friendly and helpful staff.
Comfy bed.
Mini fridge and microwave and coffeemaker in room"
The sheet and the blanket for sofa bed were not clean. I was itch all night and could not sleep. The shower tub could not drain at all. I had to put Sth to unplug the cap so the water can be drain out.
This hotel was in the perfect location for my family. It is near the Margaret Mitchell house and Olympic Park. It is also right across the street from a beautiful basilica. We also loved restaurant next door.
"HOWEVER, the breakfast wasnt really all that great...otherwise the experience of the facility is definitely worth the price.I do wish that the company itself will inform me of any extra fees beforehand so I can make sure their wouldn't be any issue"
"This is a nice, clean and affordable hotel. Easy access to the airport with a reliable shuttle service. Restaurant has decent food, but the service is slow sometimes. Always have great deals going on in the bar area."
"Location was everything forv this stay. Had business training in the Terminus building, and the hotel was a two-minute walk to workshop and nearby restaurants. Food options on premises were excellent and varied but pricy."
"Visited tge W Atlanta Downtown to have a drink with business colleague . Great drinks, crowd and staff. Centrally located for us local who work downtown . 

The bar had a great vibe and good drinks.

Valet staff very polite and attentive"
Guest rooms are very dark even though they are recently remodeled. The lobby and restaurant under construction.  the food on the makeshift breakfast buffet had cold eggs and French toast. But they still charging a sporty price.  Not worth the money.
"Came here for a girls weekend and had a blast!! Multiple hotel bars, superb staff and super clean! Great location in midtown Atlanta. The staff waited on our every need. We would definitely come back again."
"Very Nice rooms, all fresh and well appointed. Walking shower was nice. great staff! 
Great shuttle that was there on arrival at ATL ready to roll. 
Free drinks in the evening with hardbacks. 
A big breakfast that could be made to order if wanted."
"I would highly recommend this hotel.  Affordable accommodations.  Great value for the price.  Fresh, clean room.  Friendly staff. Had a problem with the toilet flushing properly.  The staff was quick to respond and repair.   I would definitely stay here again when I'm in the area."
"Fabulous staff, beautiful hotel, delicious breakfast. Within walking distance of braves game. We had a rough start at another hotel, thank goodness we made the decision to move! Clean, courteous and convenient."
"Hotel was in a great location, ambience in the lobby was delightful, the room was clean & comfortable, amenities were nice and the staff was wonderful. With all that, the nightly rates were unbelievably reasonable. Great place to stay in Atlanta."
"I was not served in accordance to what a guest should expect, my room was not made up and tiles in bathroom were loose as well as breakfast was not fresh and good.  I had a staff that seemed ambivilant to me"
"The hotel rooms and public areas are very nice and the staff is excellent. However, there is no escape from the street noise that can be heard in the guest rooms and even in rooms on the top floor."
"What a nice building where this hotel is located! Neighborhood is not the best one, but hotel is worth a stay! Very efficient personnel, large and nice rooms, valet parking, good restaurants!

Had a great stay! Would go definitely back there!"
"Poorly maintained property in a great location. Furniture dinged, shower/tub area needs attention. A/C unit had filter hanging out. This motel gets heavy wear and looks it. If given the chance, stay somewhere else."
The staff was wonderful at the InterContinental. Any questions or issues I had the staff resolved or answered them very quickly .  The Restaurant and bar were good.  The room was very clean and my wife and I slept wonderfully.
"I was so impressed from start to finished with the service, cleanliness, food and beverages, and overall stay with the Westin.  I felt like the red carpet was rolled out as soon as I stepped foot into the hotel, and I cannot wait to return."
"Staff was extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating.  Made me feel welcome and cared about.  Really enjoyed the stay because of the staff.  Have stayed here before and will stay here again.  Great valu"
"Stayed for a weekend. The Hotel and service were superb. We ordered dinner and breakfast from the hotel and it was absolutely delicious. We were able to relax and enjoy the quiet and nicely decorated room. 

Jambalaya is a top pick."
I tried for two days to get a broken pack n play replaced it took 5 tries. There was no sheet for the crib.  The hotel was full and they did not have enough help.  They do have a good breakfast and welcome reception
We stayed there this pass weekend and it was very pleasant. Check in was painless and quick. The bellman was so nice and informative. We stayed on the club floor and wasn't disappointed. All in all it was a great stay.
The price is right.  The hotel lobby is very nice clean and pretty.  Had difficulty finding bottled water and the bed was very uncomfortable.  The transportation to and from the hotel was great.  Staff was all very accomdating and helpful.
Raise prices for market terribly.  Room was never cleaned in 5 days.  Towels only.  Tvs did not work and so no movies.  Could never reach the front desk upon arrival.  Only operators.  South tower run down and shabby.
The service is exceptional.  My room is on the 7th floor and for some reason I keep hearing banging on the wall.  I just ignored it.  It is definitely an updated hotel and walkable to restaurants and anything midtown Atlanta..
"My apologies about the events that led to your dissatisfaction, please contact me at the hotel for further assistance."
Please note that the hotel denies all accusations that have been made.  This is a matter that is being handled through our Third-Party Administrator on our behalf and is following all insurance guidelines.
"I enjoy staying at this location while I'm in downtown Atlanta.  With the renovations recently completed, the rooms are updated, fresh, and clean.   The staff was very friendly and accommodating and always willing to assist ."
Great rooms - perfect location - walk to shopping and dining. Club level was incredible - cocktails and heavy appetizers - we almost didnÃ¢ÂÂt go to dinner!  Awesome bar and courtyard too!  Yummy breakfast spread too!  Great place to hang out.
"Stayed one night for business in a neighboring office tower.  The only difficulty i had with the hotel was finding the self parking sign.  everything was very clean, the staff was super friendly, and the AC was on full blast."
The manager was not friendly and paranoid about a loyal guest having a small pet. The pet fee is $75 and they question you while you are walking your pet in the designated area. I will not stay at this location in the future.
"Very nice facility well kept. Staff was preoccupied with their issues and did their work but without any personal touch. Breakfast was good but some obvious things were missing: bagels, bacon, and one shared salt n pepper shaker."
"had a wonderful time at the hotel, clean, spacious, room service both nights, hot and food was excellent. Very impressed.  Staff was helpful and courteous, they could not do enough for the guests, always pleasant and smiling, it was nice to see."
"Here for junior theater festival with about a thousand kids.  Hotel is very nice and accommodating, and a safe place for kids.  You should ask for Frederick if you have a choice of bellmen, he is very friendly and helpful."
Great location.  My room was upgraded at check in without me asking.   Valet service was excellent. Lots of restaurants in walking distance. Very clean and updated room. Helpful staff. Pretty quiet for a downtown location
Stayed here while attending a wedding in Atlanta.Everyone from the valet to the restaurant were pleasant and accommodating. Would definitely stay there again. Located near good restaurants and shopping alsa.
Rooms were very clean and bed was extremely comfortable.  Very well staffed and everyone was kind and helpful.  Food and service in the restaurant was great.  Everything I needed was within walking distance.
Ambience was amazing. Hotel room was clean. Great customer service. Amazing breakfast buffet. Could it get any better? One of the best places IÃ¢ÂÂve stayed in. View from my room was also amazing. Would definitely recommend.
"The staff were all very kind, welcoming, and helpful. The room was comfortable and clean. Free breakfast had a good amount of choices. Coffee was pretty good for a hotel, too! Would definitely stay here again."
Clean and comfortable.  Plenty of space to spread out. The mini fridge was useful. My only gripe was the lack of outlets. Only one outlet on the wall and the ones on the lamp.  The bathroom was roomy and the shower was fine. Very clean.
No glasses in cupboard.  Before we left we found them in dishwasher from last guest.  Internet wifi was off most of the stay.  Room was big.  Shower was nice.  Pet fee was $75.  Which was excessive.  No restaurant.  It was quiet.
This was one of my best hotel stays ever. The staff was so pleasant and gave attention to detail. The food was excellent. So what if I had to pay for the breakfast. It was much better than other places. I'd stay here again.
We were in Atlanta for the Bucs/Falcons game and to celebrate our anniversary.  The Hotel is beautiful - inside and out.  Loved the gardens and our room was spotless.  Staff was very friendly and always smiling.  I would stay here again - without a doubt.
"Staff not very helpful. I was told to ""come get it myself "" when I called front desk and asked for coffee creamers both mornings of my stay.  Coffee doesn't get out out until 7:00 and it was 6:15-6:30 in the morning."
The hotel was not what we expected. The room went uncleaned and the AC did not cool. The breakfast staff made people feel uncomfortable and rushed. They are plenty of other hotels that would be a better choice.
I was very satisfied with the level of service with the Doubletree. Very clean with great service. I would consider this establishment a great value. In addition this location provides great access to the Buckhead location.
"Room was clean.  They do not have room service for lunch and dinner.  Breakfast was a good variety.  Pillows were too soft, woke up with a headache, but bed was comfortable and there was no outside noise in the hallway."
Great location.  With-in walking distance of plenty of venues.  Courteous staff. Room was clean and spacious. Nice view of surrounding area. Would definitely stay here again. Check-in and check-out was easy.
Bed sheets felt like plastic. Not what I've come to experience at my previous Hyatt trips - but totally unacceptable. This would keep me from ever staying here again. Overall hotel is very nice; great location.
"Thager is so kind and we had a lovely stay. Room was spotless, he made excellent restaurant suggestion, greeted us with towels when we ran in from the rain, and made sure we got off to a great start in the morning. Thank you!"
We are happy to hear that you had a wonderful experience during your stay with us and look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to the city!
Excellent hotel convenient to everything hotel. The staff was great and very accommodating. The bar was EXCELLENT! Andre really took care of us and we all had a ball watching the NFL Playoffs in the lobby!
"Had a great time here for a recent conference. Special thanks to Kamisha who helped us out with parking. Will be back if any event takes me here in the future. Thanks Sheraton for the experience, five stars."
I could not connect to the internet for 2 days and was using my iphone for a hot spot. . I finally called front desk and they sent Ralph up to my room. Ralph had me up and running in a jiffy. Great service.
"Took my wife for a short birthday celebration. All the staff made sure to say hello as we'll as happy birthday along with proving a birthday dessert in the room for us. Great pool, facilities, and overall staff experience."
"Property overall is nice and conveniently located however sevice was ""spotty"" and maintenance/housekeeping is not on top of issues even when brought to their attention.  For the calibre of property, you should not see paint peeling in the shower ceiling."
"Gorgeous room, bathroom is so modern and immaculate. Staff goes out of their way to help, great gym and pool.  An excellent choice for a luxury hotel.  Shopping and restaurants are nearby but not really within short walking distance."
Stayed for business thin doors that you can hear people talking in the hallway. The kitchen burned something at 2:30 AM set fire alarm off. I forgot my phone charger in the room and they claim to not have found it.
"Looks like remodeling is finished and feels like new hotel. Location is great, staff is amazing. The room gives you comfy feeling. Really enjoyed southern hospitality... 
Will definitely stay here again!"
Everything was perfect it was my birthday I had friends over to celebrate until my party bus arrived all employees was very nice the hotel and room was vet clean and nice wish i couldÃ¢ÂÂve tried the pool but maybe next time
The Embassy Suites has excellent accommodations and caring staff. The hotel has been newly renovated with dynamic deco. The lobby is spectacular and the rooms remain with the comfort of the traditional Embassy.
"Even though the hotel was only a decent hotel, how employees treated me made me feel I am at a high class hotel."
"Thx. so much for your review. We're so glad you and your family enjoyed your stay with us, and could get clean in the process, LOL. We hope you guys will come back and stay with us again!"
"There is an incredible bartender, Calvin Delaney III, who goes way above and beyond merely serving drinks and foods.... He is an amazing, well spoken, cordial, and funny person who takes each customer very personally and serves with pride."
Very good service -= rooms as you would expect (although odd not to have drawers to put in clothes).  Great location relative to walking into the mall and having a good choice of places to eat and walk to in the neighborhood.
Nice hotel with good location for business. Excellent filet mignon & calamari & dessert at restaurant. Friendly staff. No bathtub or microwave in room. Nice neighborhood & gardens. Perfect for a short business trip.
We stayed with family for one night. Excellent experience with breakfast and hotel staff. I certainty recommended this hotel for business and family stays. The team serving breakfast are a bunch of happy and very caring people.
The staff was really nice especially Inga in the dining room. She always had a smile and made my meals feel special. The rooms were updates and comfortable throughout my entire stay. No complaints from me.
Thx. so much for your comments. We're so glad you enjoyed your room and stay during your convention. Please come back and stay with us again (when you're not working!).
"Was only there for one night, but everyone on the staff was very friendly and professional, especially Shakil.  Would stay there again.  The location was convenient.  Only problem was the sirens, but that's to be expected next door to an Emergency Room."
Great service and overall great experience. Thanks to Dorsey and Karla for a quick check out. Rooms were very clean the employees were very courteous. The food was good. Managers were all very pleasant.
We didn't know of any places to go for food and shopping since we had never been to Atlanta. Dave and josh and the rest of the staff gave us excellent advice always had the shuttle ready and we're just lots of fun!
"Visited just a bit for breakfast before meeting colleagues. The food wasn't great and the coffee was awful, but the front desk, dining room and housekeeping staff taking care of the lobby were top-notch.  Kudos to them all for their warm welcome!"
"On outskirts of Atlanta. Good decoration clean really large room consisting of bedroom, bathroom with shower over bath and a lounge room. TV in lounge room and bedroom. Buffet breakfast good selection but service slow for being served coffee and clearing tables."
"We were in-town for a funeral.  Meeting family at airport was made easy using the shuttle.  Having good food available was a bonus. No noise from airport or highway nearby.  Excellent facility, polite and helpful staff."
"Please bring some of allergy medicine with you.
Sleep quality was very bad with old beds and not yet cleaned properly.
Try to choose other hotels.!if you wanted to stay in Hyatt. Get different location please."
"Stayed here for four nights and so glad I selected this hotel. Beautiful old building with modern amenities. Very clean, hip decor and well equipped. The staff was so friendly and helpful. If I ever find myself back in Atlanta I will stay here again."
Stayed here for the 2nd time. Love the decor of this property.  Super friendly staff.  Reasonably priced.  Lots of extra services.  I would recommend staying here anytime.  Be sure to ask the bell man to take you for a ride in the SUV!
This is a very nice and clean hotel with nice amenities. the fitness room is great with cardio equipment and weights. The staff is friendly and attentive. The location is great. I have no complaints about this hotel.
A good hotel but the entrance lobby lacks any sense of grandeur and there were no lounge and bar areas. The staff were really friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Conveniently located by Lenox Square shopping precinct and local subway stop.
"Nice place, Great Location Near the Airport, Made for Air Crew, Room Service, Fun Lobby Bar, bit expensive, hard water (they have lotion to make up for this), Airport Shuttle, Friendly Staff, and hard beds."
"Awesome news!  I am so glad that you had a great stay with us.  We hope that you come back again.  As a HHonors member you are our most valued guest!

Home away from home. Very nice staff . Hotel is always clean and beautiful. I really do hate to leave. It's good for business and personal. I would return anytime.i got a wonderful rate through Priceline. This Marriott does stand up to its name.
"This hotel is in a great location, very comfortable CLEAN rooms, and wonderful helpful staff.  They greet you with a smile, and are happy to help in any way that they can. Overall awesome hotel experience!"
I can't say enough about how great this place is to stay. the staff was some of the most friendliest i've ever met and the location can't be beat for things to do. and as always you can't go wrong with Omelets made to order!!!
The staff was so welcoming and pleasant all the time. Rosemary Atean in the dining room was so kind and was very attentive to my needs and took time to talk to me and keep me company while I waited for my business associates.
"Worst night at a Hyatt property when a whole building exhaust fan ran all night.  Loud, deep rumble, shaking and vibrating the room walls until it was turned off the next morning.  Other than that unpleasant experience, the room was good."
"Your complimentary review of our hotel is much appreciated! We understand there were a couple things that were not quite to your liking but we are glad your overall experience was a good one.  Hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to host you again soon."
"Huge convention hotel.   Everything is tan and brown, so not exactly a boutiquey feel, but comfortable to many I'm sure.     Great bar downstairs with wonderful people.   Awesome service.   A massive hotel but good people."
"The service was tremendous.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  The room was beautiful.  My wife had several spa treatments and had nothing but good things to say. Ladies,  get the facial. The only negative was the pool was closed for repairs."
"Proximity to airport, rent cars and train is outstanding. Room was excellent. Bed superior, clean and quiet. Restaurant was above average and reasonable for an airport hotel. Service personnel were friendly and helpful."
The room and bathroom were very clean! Staff was very friendly and helpful. Would stay here again! Was here for a family wedding and was very close to the wedding ceremony. Only about a 20 or 30 minute drive from the airport with traffic!
My stay at this hotel was excellent.  The rooms were comfortable and the staff were extremely helpful. The staff at the Concierge desk were most helpful in assiting with my return trip to the airport. I would highly recommend this hotel to others.
Everything was great. Staff is efficient and friendly. The rooms were nice and clean! The hyatt house was a great stay! The valet were fast and helpful. Hyatt house i will definitely stay there again!
"Friendly staff, Clean, great location, comfortable bed. WiFi did not work great. Bathroom seemed crowded and not well set up. Had to reach almost to back of toilet for toilet paper, non skid on tub bottom was rough on feet."
We stayed at this hotel with another family. Very nice hotel with a couple of restaurants within walking distance. Free complimentary shuttle to Suntrust Field. Ashley and Jeffery at the front desk were absolutely awesome. Would stay here again without a doubt
Hotel was very nice and recently remodeled.  The staff was very pleasant and engaged.  Location was within walking distance to many offices and restaurants and also offered a very convenient shuttle within a few mile radius.
Was here for a convention. Very nice hotel and good location downtown. Staff was very friendly. Close to the MARTA station which is convenient for going to and from the airport. Would recommend this place and stay here again.
"Excellent hotel. Every staff member I came in contact with was very courteous and polite. The rooms were very clean. For me, the beds were very comfortable. Location of hotel to Suntrust Park could not have been better."
the lobby was  very impressive when you walked in. I was very disappointed with the room especially the bathroom.  Nothing great....average room with tiny bathroom.  The beds were very comfortable.  Not a bad stay just a little disappointingfor Marriott.
"Service was great, room was clean and very comfortable and until now the whole experience was great.  Having to type in more than 200 characters for this review has been the only negative aspect of the stay"
I always enjoy my stays at the Embassy Suites Centennial Park . The staff are always helpful kind and professional. It's a very relaxing homelike atmosphere. Even though I'm there for business the environment allows me to unwind and relax.
"The entry to this hotel is very nice, the rooms are subpar. Add ons are breakfast $17 (buffet), parking lot parking $10, microwave $10. All based per day....in addition to your 6 day is pricey. I will not even mention the shower Ã°ÂÂÂ"
"I visited this hotel for a conference.  It is a beautiful hotel in a great, centrally located service. The staff delivers excellent and professional service. Food was excellent.  Great choice for business or pleasure."
"Our stay at the Ritz Carlton in Buckhead was wonderful! We could not have asked for better service and accommodations!! The valet, front desk service, late night room service , and everything else was absolutely fabulous!! No problems at all!!!"
The downstairs dining areas were lovely and the location was perfect but the hallways were dark and unclean and the rooms were not very luxurious.  The hotel area looks like it was badly converted from some other use to use as a hotel.
"Very nice hotel for the money, very quiet, great staff.  I would definitely stay there again.  My wife is very particular about her hotels, she agreed it was nice place.  Very clean hotel.  Location is pretty good for getting into Buckhead."
My stay at Sonesta was pathetic. They don't stay on their words.The Sales Director promised me to provide the room on very genuine prices via. Mail but when I moved to Sonesta they ignored that mail and charged us the room on the regular prices.
"We spent two nights and loved it. The room were very spacious, clean and it is centrally located to many attractions. We booked it through pricleline and paid $50 a night."
"This hotel isn't good, entire hotel look old and scary. Part of the lights were out in the hall way of the hotel, it wasn't a good stay that I was use to"
Easy access to field locations and restaurants.  Nice waiting  area for enjoying other people in your group.  Restaurants inside hotel. Hotel staff pleasant and helpful .Clean inside and around the hotel.
"The hotel is conveniently located in Atlanta Perimeter area, close to a mall, close to the I-285 highway and easy access to I-75 and I-85. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful and the rooms are modern. Great hotel."
Great reno of the old Ritz.  Concierge level amenities are first rate.  Parking situation definitely improved on value.  A good solid choice in Buckhead.  The food in restaurant could use improvement.  The bar and wine selections are quite good.
I stay at this hotel every year for the taste of Atlanta. It's in a great location and we love the bartender Kenneth that works the on site bar. He is always good at recommending drinks for my friends.
Wife and I were waken to the sound of a jackhammer inside of the hotel.  I understand construction but this was at 1 AM.  Hotel  acknowledged  their mistake however denied me a refund.  Not what I expected from an embassy suites
We apologize that you had to experience all this during your stay with us. We would love if you stay with us again to have the opportunity to show you that this was not our typical level of cleanliness or service at our hotel.
Nice bar/restaurant. Comfortable but small room. Great downtown location near MARTA and streetcar. Walking distance to Olympic Park. Housekeeping needs more diligent management. Shouldn't charge for bottled water.
"Decent hotel could use upgrades! For the price just go to a regular hyatt! Carpet was dirt, bathroom dirty and moldy! The bed spread was supposed to be white but looked like it has not been cleaned in a while!"
Can for a business conference. The location is good in a good area. Lots of restaurants around and stuff. The conference catered food was incredible. Great staff. Clean room. Nice view. Plenty of light in the room. Quiet sleep at night.
Great breakfast! Clean rooms! Excellent customer service! I love the fact they have Ruth's Chris restaurant as an option to eat dinner at or grab a drink from the bar. We will definitely be back in the future!
"My very first time visiting Atlanta ,the front desk agent Ms.CaTedra was very friendly and understanding while I stayed there.The room was clean amazing ,the housekeeping was on time,fantastic experience.Thank to the entire staff at 1380 Virginia Av"
I was attending a conference in the hotel.  The food was really good...very flavor full and lots of options.  The staff was also very helpful and eager to assist at any moment.  I like my privacy and they respected that as well.
The Emory Conference Center is an excellent place to stay.  It is very comfortable and well maintained.  The staff work hard to make you feel at home.  The food is delicious and I enjoy the Center every time I stay there.
The saty was very comfortable as usual with Home Wood Suites. The location of the hotel is best suited for business and liesure travellers. It is with in 1 mile from Galleria business center and Cumberland Mall.
"Just try talking to anybody at this hotel  -- they know nothing but what ""it""  (their computer screen) tells them.  The service is incredibly poor.  There is no hospitality.  Just a computer-generated algorithm off a nondescript highway."
My wife and I stayed at the Ellis Hotel again and it is always a great experience.  We stayed in the executive suite this time and the view of Peachtree Street and the surrounding area was magnificent.  The staff was friendly like always!
"We got this room because we had a three o'clock a m airline departure. The rooms were very clean, beds were  comfortable, and they had shuttle to the airport.  Staff was friendly and I would go back there again."
Great location for the game and close to multiple food and entertainment options.  Rooms were very nice and clean.  Pool area was very pretty and well maintained.  Great selection of food items for breakfast.  Everyone I came into contact with was very friendly and helpful.
"It is not bad but it does not worth the price:   water leakages from tap, hairdryier malfunctioning, cleaning gloves forgot over the table by personnel, ventilation extremely noisy....all these elements were not expected. The personnel is kind. The breakfast is so so.
Enjoy"
"Had a wonderful girlfriend weekend accommodations at this all suite hotel! The front desk clerk Eric gave outstanding service not only to us, but all guest! Nicest Sheraton property that I've been to so far!
And the mall and restaurants are in walking distance!!,"
We sincerely apologize for falling short of your expectations as this is not typical of the high standards we strive to maintain. We hope that you will allow us another opportunity to serve you better in the future
"The hotel is very nice, with a beautiful lounge on the entry level, and fine dining above.  Room was well suited, however that bath could use some updating.  The bedding and pillows were very nice, but the bath lacked in size and cleanliness."
"always treated very well from staff and this location is very accessible for many of thee top doctors in atlanta, there are also great dinning options nearby. if you want to leave hotel, but he staff is really what makes this hotel great."
"Very Good service, room, food, bar and overall stay. You will enjoy. I think any traveler whether business or for pleasure will enjoy this stay. I think the bed was a little soft, but I like very firm beds."
"Wedding weekend very nice. Only thing add more wash towels is what had to calling for ,we had five peoples in the room. Services was fine. Very helpful. A very nice hotel and location was good. Will stay again."
"They need to make some changes to the quality of breakfast. It was a good stay but it could have been better. The staff was friendly.  It's close to a lot of shopping, the interstate and food restaurants."
Will NEVER stay at this hotel and will never recommend it to anyone!!!!!!!!!! Cancelled the reservation in the time frame I was suppose to and still got charged $150.00.  Not happy with this experience and will not ever stay there again!
"My stay at this hotel was excellent. Everything was at it's best. My room was clean, smelled fresh and was very comfortable. The beds were very comfortable, I slept like a bear hybernating. I definitelywill come here again, when in  Atlanta."
Too bad in the bad way.  I had a horrible experience at this hotel and I travel all the time.  Construction going on INSIDE all day and into evening (through dinner)  Help was not responsive when asked for something.
"Thx. so much for your review. We're so glad you enjoyed your room and stay, and our fitness center!, Please come back and stay with us again, soon!"
"From the front desk experience checking in, to getting helpful advice, to the quality of the rooms, the comfort of the bed, to help with departure, this was all a wonderful experience. Would gladly return again to this property when in the Atlanta area."
We were celebrating our anniversary and my boyfriend's birthday and we had a wonderful time. There was nothing I would change about the hotel everything met and exceeded out expectations. I love the Marriott brand and will continue to be a loyal member.
"Older hotel nicely maintained and well-staffed.  Bathroom was small, but ok for me.  Breakfast food was definitely a cut above with unique items and regular favorites.  Lots of variety presented attractively.  Cage-free eggs and natural breakfast meats.  Clean and restful."
"DÃÂ©cor 1994, cleanliness was minimal, service was questionable, Internet never worked properly, price was 3 times Motel 6 but the Motel 6 was probably more up to date."
"Great location, very convenient.  Airport shuttle gets you to the airport quickly.  Hotel rooms were very quiet despite being so close to the airport.  Comfortable bedding.  Would definitely stay here again."
"TV remote broken, terrible humidity with damp sheets, mold on the roof of the shower. Area outside of the bed room was nice if I were to fully use it. Internet was fine. Breakfast was alright, so meh."
"Picked this place for a business trip. First time staying at a Marriott hotel. Everything was perfect: the bed, the food, the hospitality, the bathroom, the view. I honestly wanted to stay here longer. The Marriott is now my go-to place for all future travel."
From the outside staff to checking in etc it is always a GREAT experience.  If in the past if something was incorrect it was fixed ASAP. I have never had a better experience with a hotel as I d with the Bulkhead Ritz Carlton
"We had a great stay for the weekend! Close to everything!  We unfortunately attended a family funeral, but knowing we had a safe and clean place to rest made it a little more comfortable. We appreciate the kindness and professionalism of the staff."
This was my first time staying at this hotel and I was very impressed with the customer service provided by Dorsey who was the first desk attendant. When I return to Atlanta for business again I will definitely consider staying at this location.
"Thx. so much for your comments, and for being our guest. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay. Please come back again soon the next time you're in Buckhead!"
"This is a very nice hotel. We loved the layout of the room. Very quiet, staff members were very polite, and they were accommodating.  Only complaint was the water took forever to warm up in the shower."
Very nice hotel. Seemed like I was in an apartment instead of a hotel. Complimentary Breakfast was excellent and upscale. The staff were extremely polite and accommodating. The full kitchen in the room was fully stocked with dishes and pots/pans. Great place to stay.
Great hotel in a good location close to services.  Great staff and good service.  Really Funky decor. The rooms are really big and comfortable.  The bathrooms too.  The bar selection is like a shop.  Everything you could need or want.
It was like a little apartment! Very clean and comfortable. Was very modern with dÃÂ©cor and gave a home feeling!  The breakfast was included and was very good. I will definitely stay again!!!! Would recommend!
"Very good hotel.  It's very well located at a good location in downtown and has a MARTA station a few steps away.
The staff is very nice and helpful.
The room was spacious and well decorated. 
In room wi-fi is free."
The Whitley was formerly The Ritz. The change to Whitley is great- better atmosphere. Staff is still great as is food at all the venues. Well located in Buckhead near retail of all ranges and restaurants
"Room was comfortable, bedding was lovely, really enjoyed both restaurants, and the bar area.  Nice rooftop venue attached to hotel, great if you need to have a party or event.  Staff was wonderful. Good location."
The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Valet parking was awesome and rhe guys were so friendly.   Checkup the guy who put our luggage on the cart was extremely nice and remember my name throughout the weekend.
"The hotel and the staff were magnificent and the location of the hotel was also in the perfect location, being close to the the Cumberland Mall, downtown and close to major highways for quick access to many attractions that Atlanta has to offer."
"The best part of the stay was the food.  We had a large conference of attendees, and the planned meals were excellent.  Additionally, the hotel is beautifully appointed, extremely clean, and the staff outstanding."
Very clean and comfortable. Great amenities and friendly staff. My daughter prearranged a birthday surprise prior to arrival to be in our room but they neglected to follow thru. Dissapponted but would recommend and stay again.
"For the same price as a normal hotel room in the Buckhead area, this hotel provides a suite, breakfast in the morning and free parking!  Great location - within walking distance of several restaurants, grocery store, shopping.  Will definitely stay again!"
"Everything was excellent.  Staff in all areas were professional, friendly and helpful.  We could not have been happier.  Event planning handled by Uli Burgess was  outstanding as was the staff attending the event."
Nice place. Modern feel. Clean. Good location for downtown activities. Good food choices within walking distance. Staff was friendly and helpful. Bed was comfortable. Enjoyed the visit and had no complaints.
"Very comfortable, spacious room for an overnight when traveling in or out of ATL.  We will stay again. You do hear traffic noise - airport and highway - but it is an airport hotel so that has to be expected.  It wasn't excessive at all."
"One of the most organized, gracious, professional, personal and enjoyable hotels.  The only drawback, the limited menu selection at the hotel restaurant.  Otherwise, what we ordered was delicious and cooked as we requested.  Excellent staff in every aspect of the hotel.  Beautiful outdoor surroundings."
Your business is important to us and I will definitely take your comments into consideration concerning the parking. I thank you very much for your review and sincerely hope that you will give us another opportunity and stay with us next time youÃ¢ÂÂre in town.
Beautiful hotel in the center of Atlanta. Easily located about a mile off the interstate. Everyone friendly and helpful. I was there for a meeting - meeting areas were good. The rooms are comfortable and clean. Food is good but quite expensive.
"Stayed here four days on business, the staff at every turn was attentive and just plain smiley and nice.  This fun is in their nature and shows great signs of a collective group of positive people.  Really enjoyed their friendliness and service all around."
"Very poor value while this hotel is under renovation. There is NO access to any public facilities, the lobby, restaurant, pool, etc. It was a poor management decision to keep this hotel open given the amount of renovation taking place."
"Filthy behind bed and side tables 
Workout room equipment not working
Worn bedcovers and sheets
HGI can do so much better.

Staff is wonderful.
Location is great.

Just need to pay attention to the details."
I stayed here in September and was very impressed. The bedroom was very elegant. The bathroom was huge with a spa sized tub and wonderful towels. There were orchids in the bathroom and bedroom. A very nice touch! I would definitely stay here again.
"I can't say enough good things about the employees. The hotel however, is below disappointing. I would never recommend it. It is described as a beautiful boutique hotel, but it has sorely missed the mark."
"I spent a weekend ""Staycation"" at this hotel and loved every bit of it. The staff is very helpful and suggested some awesome places to see, eat, and enjoy ourselves. The Sky Lounge is the best. I will be returning."
"Friendly staff, clean, comfy beds, great pool and hottub, good breakfast. I chose this place for the indoor pool and the good ratings from other guests. I was not disappointed at all. It was quiet, clean, and comfortable."
Had a very nice time on my vacation for my friends birthday we really had a great time and got to experience a lot of Atlanta and surrounding cities meeting great people and ran into a few celebrities who were very humble people
"We stayed here for our family reunion. People came as far as Arizona. We loved breakfast, the staff, the large rooms and all of the other amenities. Hotel provides transportation within 5 mile radius, even to the mall."
Attentive and helpful staff with great recommendations and attitudes. The complementary drinks and snacks well exceeded my expectations. We will definitely come back to stay whenever we are in Atlanta!
"Friendly reception staff, lovely bar area, fast elevators, stylish and comfortable rooms and reasonably priced. A short walk to Atlanta's Downtown area and the Peachtree Center MARTA subway. I recommend this hotel to tourists, visitors or businessmen."
Love the service and the rooms (always clean) but could use some firmer pillows.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  The Hyatt is my first pick when staying in Atlanta and is convenient to the Marta.
"We are excited to hear that you enjoy staying with us and that our staff is consistently professional, friendly and helpful.  We truly look forward to having you stay with us again in the near future.

Thank You,"
I really enjoyed the hotel.  The room was very spacious and the bathroom was amazing.  The bed was very comfortable.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
"Many hotel problems.  Upgrades sorely needed.  Good $ deal and location. Housekeeping bad.  Room smelled and in disrepair.  Staff mostly nice and tried, but many things falling apart and broken in room.  Would love to return to this area but look at another hotel."
Artmore was a wonderful atmosphere and stay. The staff is helpful and friendly. The room are nice and well maintained. The valet is convenient and quick. The bar and courtyard is a wonderful place to relax and unwind. Would definitely stay again.
Wonderful friendly & helpful staff. Nothing was a problem. The room was clean and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The bistro made wonderful coffee and the food was good. Good shopping & restaurants in the nearby mall
We're so glad we could be of service. Please come back and stay with us again!
"Josh was very helpful at check-in.  Rooms were comfortable, but small (which was OK).  A little disappointed that toiletries were not refreshed on second day.  Restaurant a little overpriced, but wait staff excellent."
The property was very clean. I liked the idea that my family had space and wasn't crowded. The breakfast was full of variety and hot. I would definitely stay at this location again when I'm in the area.
"This is my fifth stay at Embassy Suites Olympic Centennial Park.  The hotel has great amenities in the lobby, very convenient.  For our fast paced trips these and the complimentary breakfast are of great value.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable."
I stayed here recently for 3 nights while my father was in Emory Hospital.  It was so nice to return here each evening.  The food was delicious (Really!) The bartender was awesome and the service was great!  The rooms did not disappoint either!
The staff at Hyatt House are always so friendly from the front desk to dining to guest room services.  I've stayed here frequently over the past 6 months and home like friendly environment keeps me coming back.
The lounge is a great place for down time. The decor inspires relaxation. I Was especially impressed with Kristie Johnson. She was very knowledgeable and attentive. The chicken was awesome! I strongly recommend this downtown Atlanta destination.
"Please let all employees kno about the extra hidden fees up front, and i still havenÃ¢ÂÂt been refunded for that"
Great experience at a very nicely furnished and supported hotel. Staff was helpful in ever department. Rooms cleaned at good times. Restaurants had excellent offerings at good prices. The meeting rooms for conference were easy to find and very comfortable.
"This was my second visit.  Great place to stay.  Clean and spacious.  Comfortable beds, nice part of Atlanta.  Very close to a Trader Joe's and Pier 1 Imports... other shops too, but these are two of my favorites.  Starbucks right otw to interstate.  Nice!"
"Stayed Friday night. Check in under 5 minutes. Room was comfortable and clean, staff was great. Will stay again."
"Happy 23rd wedding anniversary! 
We are so happy you chose to celebrate with us! 
We strive to provide our guests with an aesthetic that is new, now and BOLD. 
We hope to see you back next year!"
this staff is all about service and making you feel welcome I have stayed there many times and always hate to leave. the restaurant is good and there is a lot to do within walking distance during daytime hours
"Jamal S we at the Hyatt House want to apologies that your experience was not a perfect one,
Please allow us to make this up to you so that you will have a wonderful stay ."
"So clean, so nice. Check in a breeze, check out even easier. Valet is on the ball. Location in vicinity of limited shopping with a few nearby restaurants but in ATL you're going to go out and explore anyway. Great all-around stay."
"wonderful staff, rooms and location.  Every thing was great!!!! The beds were sooooooo comfortable!!!!  We had a family reunion there, everyone was so pleased with the rooms and the service we received.  If we have another on in Atlanta, we will use this hotel again!!!!!"
Wonderful large room with perfect beds and linens. Nice attention to details with the cleaning. Helpful and friendly staff. The red light in the bathroom mirror is a tv! Convenient location if you want to take a walk.
I thought this place was fine. Bartender could use some help or some training. Alarm did not work. Overall stay was good while it was not perfect by any stretch of imagination. Would try again to make sure I am being fair.
"The staff was very helpful during our stay, no matter the hour. One staff member went out of hey way to help my sick wife --- plus she was super polite. The rooms were nice & clean as well so our overall experience was great."
"No service, room and facilities in poor and dirty state.  Carpets ripped, bath ceilings leaks and peeling paint. Terrible furniture, old and ripped. Facilities smelled.  No means to get drinks or snacks after hours,"
"It is really convenient to Convention Center, but I will not stay here again. Place is really dated. Stuff in rooms doesn't work, pillows are terrible and seems like nothing has been updated.  Plenty of other more modernized options nearby."
Have stayed here 3 weekends already and will be many more. Can't beat the value anywhere else. Very clean and nice rooms. Staff is great also. Great location close to downtown. It only takes a few minutes to get anywhere.
"Hotel is great, rooms clean and large, restaurant is very good, could have better white wine selection.   Take tram from airport to hotel, no shuttle!  I hate waiting for shuttles.  We have monthly meetings and space is very comfortable for medium sized gathering."
The hotel is a quick tram ride from the airport. Each and every employee that I came in contact with was friendly and helpful. The property is immaculate. My room was very nice and relaxing. Looking forward to my next stay here.
Stale Breakfast. Same choices everyday and found lots of baked potatoes under cooked. Muffins & Breads were old. No vegetarian choices for breakfast. Refer Indian recipes for several different vegetarian options.
"The people at the front desk did not seem like they really wanted to help. The rooms were not ready on time, and the rooms had paper in the beds. The hotel seemed fairly disorganized and understaffed."
"Great hotel,clean,great location,just noisy.Ask for a room not on the highway and you will be ok.I would stay again,but not on the highway.The hotel is great for seeing a show at the Fox.We weÃ¢ÂÂre back at the hotel in 5 minutes after leaving the theatre."
I've stayed at this location twice this year and have already booked another trip. The staff is very friendly and treat you like family.
It was truly a pleasure having you stay with us at the Atlanta Marriott Buckhead Hotel & Conference Center. We are happy that all our caring staff accommodated all of your needs and we look forward  to welcoming you back again soon. Thank you.
"EVERYONE at this hotel was professional, courteous and friendly. Fresh and clean appearance, right near the convention center. Absolutely nothing but high marks all around. Good restaurants and bars immediatly adjacent. I will be back."
"Location is the best.  Close to everything.  Great breakfast (However,room is freezing every time I stay there, take a sweater) We love to stay in this hotel because of the staff, location and breakfast."
Had a great stay at Four Seasons Atlanta.  The staff there are amazing and we really enjoyed the new Bar Margot!  Would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be pampered!!  The staff are amazing!!!
You will receive prompt and friendly service right from the moment you pull into the drive. The rooms are super clean high end hotel rooms. Well maintained hotel and grounds. Once you stay at this hotel it will be hard to stay anywhere else!
"Construction noise during day, but no direct adverse effect. Fridge and microwave in our room were helpful. Room adequately clean. Did not try the restaurant. No complaints, would stay again if remain reasonable rates. Recycling containers in room (usual Doubletree double trash can)."
"Like all the other Hyatt Places we have stayed in, everything was great! Having a shuttle was a good feature.  Having fresh made food was great for that late night that you just don't want to wait in a noisy restaurant."
"This was the second time that I've stayed at this particular W hotel and I loved it this time, just as much as the last. Chic decor, cool vibe, comfy beds, and convenient to lots of great restaurants and bars."
All the staff throughout the hotel was very friendly and always willing to help if you needed anything.  The food for our two banquets was fabulous.  The only problem was the hotel was very cold.  Not really a problem but turn down the air conditioning.
"Not a bad stay. Was not pleased with housekeeping. Beds were made sloppy
 Popcorn remnants was spilled, but stayed on floor for 3 days before being vacuumed up. Ice bucket not cleared out the entire stay."
We enjoyed our stay walking distance to Aquarium and dinner. Staff was very friendly and accommodating to my family. Parking is in the garage next to the hotel. Breakfast was great everyone was happy.
"Clean, comfortable, very nice staff. It was very professional and fast service....in and out like a breeze! The hotel was conveniently located outside of the city and right off the interstate. Good job!"
I love staying at the Renaissance Concourse Atlanta Hotel. Best plane viewing hotel in the world. Rooms facing the runways have balcony to watch . Food and drinks are excellent at this hotel. I recommend this hotel at Atlanta airport complex.
Perfect location to enjoy GA Dome events go Chargers! Three block walk.  1/2 block to College Football Hall of Fame. Lots of restaurants in area as well.  Beat Falcons! Won in over time.  Right next to Mercedes Dome opening next year as well.
"Exceptional experience.  ALL staff members were pleasant and helpful!  From start to finish, incredible customer service experience.  Great environment and would stay again!  Food was great, good location.  Room floor plan was spacious and inviting."
Marriott is always a wonderful place to stay. Has always been my go to chain. Thank you Amber for being outstanding.and awesome. You friendliness and patience in  answering my questions was very much appreciated. Great friendly smile too. Will be back again soon.
Great location right off I75.  Rooms were clean and modern.  Service was excellent.  Attached to the Homewood Suites.  Onsite restaurant and bar.  They only offer valet parking for $28.  Breakfast is NOT included.
"easy access and service to the airport, shuttle drivers are very helpful, friendly staff and great rooms. Check in time was lengthy but they were busy. bar/lounge was slow service to start with but once waited on was great"
had a great experience with the customer service rep in the executive lounge on the 14thfloor who provided exceptional service. Comfy beds and great breakfast buffet. The location close to Emory Hospital makes it a great location if you need to be in that area
"I had a great stay at Hotel Indigo Atlanta Midtown. The staff was was great with customer service, and overall my experience was outstanding!!!!! The hotel is in a good location close to several restaurants and bars."
Awesome hotel.. newly renovated .. great cable channels... friendly staff.. nice bar downstairs.. also a pool table in rec area fire pit.. breakfast looked ok but not really worth the price.. quiet hallways.. groovy elevator
"Very nice room, quiet and clean. Great for parking for the airport also. Very happy with this choice. The valet, Sai, took very good care of us as well handling the parking portion when we had an issue."
"Alisa - thank you for your ""top notch"" post.  Glad to learn you enjoyed our hotel.  Hope to see you again whether for your next meeting or perhaps a weekend get-a-way."
"and no one needs to disclose that you're getting a smoking room....  Also, the rooms are dingy and old...leaves a lot to be desired.  And note that there is some major construction going on next door, so don't expect to sleep in."
"The room was clean and comfortable, but the highlight of the stay was the friendly and engaging lounge bartender by the name of Topia. She was not only a good ambassador for the hotel, but also for the city of Atlanta."
So my family and I had to pleasure to stay at this hotel. Really nice hotel. We loved it! We needed some information about the area and we spoke to Charmaine at the front desk. She was super helpful and quite friendly. Great staff!
"You said it better than I ever could. 
""You can't go wrong with a W Hotel""  :)"
"Great customer service and quality.  Loved the restaurant downstairs and the pool area.  Place was convenient, clean and presentable.  
Would definitely stay there again.  Loved the idea of the lounge where people can drink unlimited and eat."
Very clean and nice and the hotel is really nice and the staff is also nice.I room was clean and everything was in place and the bathroom was spacious for me and my family.I also like the parking because it was convient
I enjoyed my stay. The room was neat and clean and the breakfast was excellent.  Our shuttle driver was nice and courteous. I'm glad that the Hyatt house is one of the preferred hotels for my company. I look forward to my next stay.
"Very clean Well maintained good ambience  Despite the high cost charging for parking is something we could not understand.  For the charges, breakfast could have been included.  Room is sufficiently large and ac is good."
"Exceptional treatment from the staff, very clean, free convenient parking, excellent breakfast with attentive staff. Definitely recommend for hotels in Atlanta, outside of the city but convenient to nearly everything."
The staff that I encountered (face-to-face) were very professional and courteous and quickly responsive to my needs. The rooms are nice and spacious.  The mattress and pillows were not the most comfortable however I rested well.  The hotel also has great amenities.
"This hotel is convenient for park and fly to Atlanta airport, and offers a free breakfast and bar. Team member Quibilluah was very courteous to me and went out of her way too make my stay enjoyable. I will definitely be returning."
The lobby was large and inviting with several small gathering areas and a variety of seating which was perfect for our very large group.  The rooms were spacious and well appointed.  All areas of the hotel were clean.  The restaurant offered great food & service!
"Great hotel in the heart of downtown. Close to a lot of different things including museums, restaurants, and more. Hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating! Rooms were comfortable and clean. We will stay there again!"

"Great hotel in central location.  Rooms are spacious, clean with good light.  Staff very helpful and accommodating.  Free room upgrade enhanced our stay when additional family member joined us.  Would love to return!"
"Hotel was very clean and spacious.  Free breakfast was more than expected, had a gentleman making omelet's to order. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
"Rooms are large and laid out nicely, very clean and the shower is one of the largest I've seen. Bed is very comfortable.   Staff is very friendly.   Location is convenient to all local down town activities in Atlanta, GA."
"Excellent location, run down hotel. condsider after remodel is complete. This is one hotel I would not bring my family to stay in the Atlanta area. There are much better places down the street or across the road."
A one of a kind awesome hotel. Decor is unique 60-70Ã¢ÂÂs auto theme. So cool! Service & food was excellent. The Location is totally perfect in peachtree center sooooo close to so many downtown Atlanta attractions.
"Had suite 509, smelled like smoke even though hotel nonsmoking.  Requested feather free room,did not happen, no foam pillows per night shift. Breakfast buffet food stale, did not freshen eggs or brittle overcooked bacon. Terrible.
Nice staff, but terrible attentionto detail. Will not stay again."
"I stayed at Emory Conference Center Hotel to attend a training workshop at the conference center. The parking, hotel, rooms, and conference center were all very nice. The staff was excellent! They were very friendly and helpful."
"We stay for a week. Service was great, rooms were great, property is in a great location, it had great amenities, security was present at all times. It also had places to eat. Would recommend to anyone."
We're so very sorry to hear your stay with us was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies.
"Seemed quiet enough for relaxing. Large clean room. No small refrigerator, bathrooms extremely small, does have a second sink area outside of bathroom which helps. Was in a location that fit our needs.  Would stay there again."
"From the Doorman, Valet, Bellmen, Concierge, Front Desk, Restaurant and Bar, Housekeeping, and Hotel Drivers, each team member is outstanding. They truly care about my experience and my comfort, which I continue to choose this fine property time after time."
Excellent place to stay in the NW Atlanta Region.  Close to Life College.  Jacuzzi was awesome.  The staff was very helpful and pleasant as always.  Free parking and easy access to the highway.  I highly recommend this Hotel
"Broken fixtures in room, staff could not keep up with guests.  Cabinet door left unsecured fell on son's foot and manager did not respond to emails.  Would not recommend this hotel.  When a manager doesn't respond to concerns, that speaks volumes"
This is my second stay and it was all good.  The rooms are clean and the price is good for Atlanta.  The pool is good for labs and they have a decent workout room.  No problem recommending this hotel.  Check in was fast and easy.
"We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us during your Family Reunion. We' loved hosting your group. Thx. so much for being our guest Please come back again, soon!"
For the most part the hotel is a great place. The breakfast could be better as the scrambled eggs look and taste like they were made from powder. I believe that there a thieves in the housekeeping staff as we had two power cords taken.
"We're so glad you enjoyed our great Buckhead neighborhood! Hope you can stay with us again, soon!"
It's so easy to go to a restaurant and hope for a good service. It is an entirely different thing when you return to a restaurant back to back to days in a row with tons of options around you because of the server.
Customer service was excellent. Room was comfortable.  I feel the hotel was centralized located for my conference. The shuttle was an excellent service. I used the bar area and the service I received was excellent.
I was very impressed with the property and the accommodations.perfect location for work.Hope to try it out again. Bed was a little hard but really liked the extras . Felt more like an apartment that a hotel .
I can't say enough about our stay at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead. The staff made our wedding night special as it was a surprise for my wife. They went over and above to ensure that all of our needs were met.
Nice hotel it is older but well kept up. Restaurant on 1st floor if I remember correctly it is called Sway has great fried chicken. The Marta stop is connected to the hotel. Only down side is the bathrooms are small
This was a last minute booking when we decided not to drive back the same night.  This was an outstanding hotel. It was either newly built or renovated. The hotel and room were clean and staff was friendly.
One of the better places we have stayed. Definitely a 5 star joint. This is a must return to with the family. Kids are javing a blast enjoying the area and my wife is enjoying the shopping. Cant wait to hit this spot up again.
"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, superior accommodations, conveniently located to anything Atlanta. Rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious. Breakfast was a great spread of food and worth the price! Beds are very comfy. If you get the chance, and have a vehicle then definitely stay here!"
"Really beautiful location, rooms very comfortable and spacious. Major frustration around additional deposit deducted from my debit card - and no mention made by the staff. Not a problem if I know to plan for it!"
"Came for a baseball tournament. No washer/dryer. No complimentary breakfast. Pool was cloudy for 5 days. One elevator working.  Floors above under construction. Mold in bathtub. Unable to sleep late, cleaning lady woke you up early."
"Great place with lots of amenities.
Only zing is parking is extremely limited and not free. No worries because valet parking was only $3 more per night ($17) than self parking. 

Great place. Very close to many things."
"This was my first stay at a Wingate by Wyndham property, and I will stay here again. The staff was attentive to my needs. My favorite thing was the fresh omelette bar breakfast."
Over price breakfast with no variety. Old bld with outdated equipment. Old and stained carpets. No cover on beds. Clogged sink and toilet. Stay away from this hotel of you can. No coffee maker  ref and microwave
This was not a bad location for price. I used this while attending weekend college courses.  The wifi was not sufficient enough to complete my assignment and reports for work which was the only downside.
After travel almost 28 hours from Bangladesh we consider hotel as home.The complimentary breakfast is the best ever I tasted.From the hotel airport transfer is free and downtown is very nearby.Best to live twin sharing basis.
I have chosen this hotel for my last 2 business trips because of the staff and the rooms.  My meeting rooms are always ready to go when I start my work day.  No complaints! I will definitely stay there again.
"From the check in to the check out the staff was excellent answered any questions I needed. The shuttle to the ball park is a great convience. The area is also good, just on the outskirts of downtown ATL"
"Hotel was close to airport, shuttle was convenient, and hotel employees were friendly.  My room was a corner room with a great view of the Atlanta skyline.  Room was nice but the bathroom could use an update."
Great hotel.  Very clean.  Bed was comfortable.  Staff was courteous and helpful.  Exercise room was well assembled.  Location was close to business and many restaurants.  Very happy with hotel.  We will return.
"Aloft is clean, modern, and staffed with warm, personable professionals! I'd definitely stay here again, as well as recommend to friends & family. They are also pet friendly and it was unbelievably clean considering this!"
My family stayed here last weekend and we had a great experience! All of the staff members were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and nice. Would definitely stay here again when in the area!
We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay with us during the Family Reunion. Thx. for being our guest. We loved hosting your group. Please come back and stay with us again!
"Nice place to stay in Atlanta. 10-15 minutes walk to world of coco-cola center, CNN center, georgia aquarium and philips arena. Room is clean and nice, the price is fair. Free breakfast and taste good."
"Really comfortable, clean and well maintained.  From airport shuttle driver to lobby cafe to breakfast buffet - top notch service.  Convenient and fairly priced.  I will definitely stay there again.  Beautiful hotel and meeting space."
"We're happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us at Grand Hyatt Atlanta. As you experienced, our guest rooms are well appointed and provide comfortable amenities and accommodations for all traveling needs. Thanks for your recommendation and we hope to see you again, soon."
"Enjoyed the time I spent here for a national conference.  Food was quite good, with beautifully prepared buffets and one sit down dinner. Conference rooms and technology were excellent.
Conference rooms were pretty chilly - needed extra sweater/jacket."
"Cesar has successfully surrounded himself with a great team - Marlin. Antoine, Bidimi
They set the tone of a great experience. Really enjoy ALOFT ATLANTA. Justin is the most accommodating night front desk manager"
The employees are very friendly.... They do go above & beyond...There was only one lady at the front desk that wasn't rude just straight forward and without a smile. The ladies over breakfast perfect.
"Great job by manager and staff during freezing weather causing travel delays and hotel flooding.  Staff went out of the way to make guests as comfortable as possible.  Breakfast was excellent, cheerfully served daily."
They have quality room service and restaurants. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Bed was very nice and sleep came easily. Shuttle was on time and convenient. Great place at the airport.  Food was excellent for in room dining and delivery was quick.
Nice hotel to stay have to pay for parking per night n the extra taxes added on when checking in aren't mention on the website but overall nice place to stay. You get your money worth at the bar when buying a drink alsoÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¢ÂÂº
"nice place near the airport.  rooms are standard, but very comfortable.  hallways are a little tired looking and due for an update.
Staff is great and their shuttle service is well managed and drivers are very helpful and friendly"
"Staff is very personable and friendly. They gave the kids popsicles, glow sticks and bubbles all weekend. Staff greeted everyone they came into contact with. Great location with many restaurants, coffee shops and shops within walking distance."
"For the entirety of our stay, every staff member offered the most impeccable customer service. The room was heavenly; the dÃÂ©cor was inspirational; and the amenities were warm and inviting. Based on our experience, we're considering purchasing one of the condos on the property."
"Nice enough hotel for the price. But the breakfast was bad. The vending machines didn't work. The service was very up and down, really good some days and awful other days. The hotel doesn't work without a car, it is to far from buses etc."
clean room. air conditioning worked fine. bartender was great. only had beers but the bar food looked great. there is a charge for overnight parking. large meeting room. I would stay there again for sure. % minutes from airport.
Hotel was clean and staff was friendly and professional.  A child had gotten sick in the lobby the following morning during checkout and the staff was very quick to take care of the problem.  Would recommend this hotel.
We do provide complimentary Shuttle service within a 3 mile radius of the Hotel.  The hours are 7AM-10AM and 3PM-11PM 7 days per week and is also available other times based on availability.
"Great location for downtown business trip.  Great bed!  Clean room w space to spare for a single person.  Extremely friendly staff.  Would stay again. Note that valet was hard to find for me, but once located it was no big deal."
My spouse and I are celebrating 25 places for 25 years and we began with your hotel.  The hotel overall is beautiful.  We were there when renovations were being completed and to come back after was great.
"I am delighted that both Fred and Finch, provided great service for you and your group, thanks for recognizing them. We will also thank them on our end as well. We look forward to serving you again."
The staff is very courteous and helpful - great at recommending local eateries.  The rooms are wonderful - very comfortable and conducive to work and pleasure. The complimentary breakfast has a huge variety and is fresh.  I particularly like the availability of fresh fruit.
"This place is great. Clean with friendly service. Close to restaurants and shopping. Enjoyed half price drinks at the bar. The shower head was crazy nice, best I've ever had. I'll stay again! Win! Winning!"
Super nice hotel.  Very friendly staff.  Rooms were very roomy. Warm cookies upon arrival.  Fast moving elevators  Great location to Braves stadium and a lot of restaurants we parked the car and walked everywhere
"Friendly staff and great evening and breakfast food, combined with the park and fly package, made our stay great.  The inside-outside pool was lovely for a swim.  The free drinks at the ""kick back"" are a lovely bonus!"
"My stay at Embassy Suite hotel this past weekend was phenomenal in every area. In the future I will only stay at EMBASSY SUITES HOTELS.   Monique Collins, Jasmine Culliver and Curtin Wiltz was so very accommodating in every way. The three of them was Spectacular."
"Modern room, nice lobby, minimal amenities, could use more lighting and maybe a comfortable chair in the room, but overall very nice and would stay there again, great location for AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs Mart, Food at Bar was better than expected"
"The rooms are typical of a residence inn.   Clean and roomy, with below average appointments for the price.  The lobby is small and unimpressive.  Staff was unremarkable.  There are limited services, typical of the brand."
"The conference center hotel has Large rooms. Fully equipped fitness center with a pool good to swim a bit. 
Recently an area with shops have been established next to the hotel that gives a bit more livelihood to the area."
"Thx. so much for your review, and for being our guest! We're sorry the weather didn't cooperate, but glad to hear your enjoyed a cozy and relaxing visit with us! Please so come back and stay with us again (rain or shine!)!"
"We stayed here because it was near one of the hospitals. Location is everything in Atlanta since things are so spread out. The hotel is a quality Hyatt and the service was outstanding, friendly and helpful at all times."
Picked this hotel while traveling to visit Emory University. Beautiful clean hotel in great location. Staff was very helpful. They were able to accommodate a request for a microwave in our room. Only downside is fee for parking but only $15 a night.
We try and always stay at a Homewood Suites. The rooms are large and the beds are so comfortable.The breakfast is excellent. We enjoy the Manager's dinners Monday through Thursday. The staff is wonderful.
"This past weekend stayed for a night.  The hotel was clean, modern, and comfortable.   The location is very convenient to restaurants and nightlife.  There is construction next door but during the weekend there is no noise."
"Best Front Desk. Best Housekeeping, Nice rooms. What else we need? Front Desk and Housekeeping were ready for best. Location also is best. We needed little longer time for checkout. Front Desk person allowed us that."
"The hotel was very nice, clean and great service. ItÃ¢ÂÂs walking distance to several good restaurants. Very convenient. The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable. Overall, I will return to this hotel."
Mattress on the king bed was very squeaky and caved in when you sit/sleep on it...both side must have had previous visitors who were weight challenged....was told hotel was in the process of changing mattresses but that future fix did not resolve my current dilemma.
The best place with the nicest guests and staff!!  Tink & Ollie loved everyone too!  This was an escape for all of us and everyone at Aloft was incredible!!!  Nice little places nearby including aquarium!!
"Friendly at check in, nice room, veey close to downtown fun, however annoyed staff when asked for towels and bandaid. Pool was a little cloudy. Nice seating and gorgeous view. Needs more organized breakfast area, had a hard time finding things."
"Bad night front desk attendant, no shampoo or conditioner in the room, front desk claimed did not have shampoo or conditioner, expensive parking fees. Parking gate code was wrong. Front desk and security guard chatting a lot and not doing their job"
"Room dirty, women's dress left in my room, over-priced. Not pleased. Much better experience at the Lake Oconee, Amelia Island, and Sarasota locations. Sure hope it is improved before our neice gets married there in October!!!"
"This is a well run, modern hotel with a staff that works hard to say yes.  The club is especially well run and worth a visit.  The hotel floors are key controlled and they have transportation to the surrounding areas."
"Enjoy every time we visit, from the reception room service to breakfast is alway terrific. They were doing some updates then so hopefully it will be worth it once I visit for my b'day in 8 more days!!!!!!!"
"work conference.  the front desk check in was painless, requested a room with view of airport, ordered room service and watch the planes take off while having dinner on balcony.  Staff attentive.  Spacious, clean room.  recommend for others traveling out of Atlanta airport."
"We're so glad to hear you enjoyed our Romance package! Thx. so much for being our guest! We hope you had a special visit! Please do come back and stay with us again, soon!"
"A little bit away from downtown Atlanta but an easy drive into the city. Very spacious, clean, and modern rooms. It was a very comfortable stay. The hotel restaurant was quite good as well.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
Very helpful young lady. Michelle had helped me so much. Everyone is good to you here. I will stay here again.  Thank you everyone for helping me.  God bless and keep up the good work.   Also the good is great
We're so glad the wedding weekend went well!  The entire team truly enjoys being part of a special event like a wedding and we appreciate you recognizing the team's efforts!
"Very happy to hear that you had a full five-star experience with us during your recent stay! For future travel reference, we do offer different room layouts that include a closed off shower room should you wish for more privacy."
"Exactly what one would expect from a 5 Star hotel, excellent facilities and fantastic service.  The Four Seasons at which I have stayed has an edge but advantage St. Regis over multiple Ritz locations I visited."
We had an amazing time. Fantastic suite. Amazing service. The only issue i actually had was with valet. They took a ridiculous amount of time getting my vehicle. The gym was nice and so was the executive lounge.
Staff is incredibly friendly. Location is great and central to many things. Price is on the more affordable end. Room decor is slightly outdated but not horrible. Room was very clean.
I am amazed at the fabulous staff and how they are able to remember your name. I had to have a medical device delivered before I arrived. I called and they acted like it was routine. Great place to stay.
Love this place! The employees are so helpful and polite. Such a pretty place and even has a bowling alley and an indoor pool! So close to restaurants! Parking is covered and underneath the hotel. Rooms are nicely decorated.
"This place is incredible for party space, be it birthday, wedding or... Only drawback is, if in space on first floor, no restrooms, must either go up or down.  Rooms very well appointed, staff incredible, location great!!"
Second time here for a business meeting. Would never go by choice. Seems like the people at the front desk work against you. Not friendly not helpful. I stay in Marriott Hotels about once a week. This is my least favorite.
Went to a conference here this month.  I think our company took over most of the hotel.  Common spaces were beautiful.  Rooms were quiet and comfortable.  Not sure about the hotel restaurants but the conference catering was great.
"Thx. so much for being our guest! We're so glad to hear we could be of service during your stay, and that you enjoyed our great downtown neighborhood. Please come back again, soon!"
All the employees were so friendly!  The manager's reception Wednesday night was great!  Delicious appetizers and very good quality cheeses.  Workout facility is fully equipped and the pool was very clean.  Such a great location that we walked to everything.
"Stayed while taking care of family business. Special deal on spacious suite, which proved useful for meetings. Excellent business facilities--appreciated having a real computer, printer and copier available without extra charge."
"Short two day stay in Atlanta for US Compost Conference. Accommodations and service were great. Personnel and staff competent. Even  valet was nice and helpful. Overall, couldn't ask for better service and treatment."
"The staff is superb!!!  The beds are comfortable, the shuttle is convenient.  The food is pretty good, they always have coffee available in the lobby at 6:00am sharp!  Keith, Nicholas and the other staff make the hotel GREAT!!"
"Super friendly staff! Clean and very quiet rooms. We really enjoyed our stay. Great breakfast! 
Next time we visit Atlanta GA, we will most likely not stay downtown, the surrounding areas felt a bit scary."
"great hotel, great location, easy to get to the city, very close to buckhead, lots of nice restaurants near by. very friendly staff. BUT close to the highway, have some low level noise from traffic all night long"
A bargain in  Buckhead! Nice property easy walk in the neighborhood. room was very nice. we will be back. A quiet little lobby bar was a great place to decompress. BBQ close by was outstanding. Plenty to see and do in Atlanta.
"Quick visit to Atlanta, in meetings for two full days, staff was great, didn't want for any thing. Room was clean, up to date, and view was great. Staff got us in and parked with out a problem.  Looking forward to my next visit"
"All are the best!from the shuttle drivers,housekeeper on up keep the good work up the food is good A++++++!!!I'm from New York city  baby!!!I WILL BE BACK!!!NEXT YEAR!!with more friends and family!!!BE BLESS!"
Well once I walked thru the door I was impressed with the lobby and welcoming feeling I received by Gabby and Bryan at the front desk!!Gabby and Bryan had great attitude and were very helpful!!i love this place
Stayed here on business.  Convenient to the area I needed to be in.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Room was nicely done and clean.  Cumberland mall is across the street with several good dining options.  Will definitely stay here again.
Stayed at this hotel for an overnight business trip and wasn't disappointed. The hotel staff and corner room provided were great.  Corner room was spacious with a view of the city. Close to Banking centers and the MARTA station. This hotel is also pet friendly
"Wonderful and friendly staff. Great location. Georgia Aquarium, College Football Hall of Fame, Centennial Park, and CNN Center are all in a 5 minute walking distance. Nice breakfast buffet and very comfortable beds."
"The hotel is conveniently located in downtown on Peachtree.  We were on the Club Access floor in the Atrium building. The Club Room provides breakfast and evening light buffet together with beer, wine or soft drinks."
To be a four star hotel I wasn't that impressed. Our sink had rings on it when we got there I'm guessing from the previous persons drinks. The bed was great and so were the pillows. Besides the bathroom everything was very clean.
"A wonderful hotel with fantastic service.  Most rooms are spacious and comfortable, but verify the bath tub as some are undersized.  Ground floor bar and restaurant are fabulous.  Much more great dining is within walking fistanve"
"Great staff, friendly and efficient - clean rooms of decent size, great location in Buckhead, convenient to many different restaurants and grocery, for outdoor exercise, there is a great neighborhood of nice homes surrounding the Buckhead business district"
We're pleased our staff was able to help make-up for most the trouble you had getting to Atlanta. We're pleased you felt our Southern Hospitality. Come back and see us soon!
"The staff was very helpful.  The room was clean and comfortable, the dining/food area is nice and large, parking is immediately adjacent.  Heart of Buckhead - well located, and convenient to Peachtree airport for those that fly into that location."
"Monica, the pretty young blonde girl at the front desk was so nice to me, I had a bad day and she went out of her way to help. Having an employee like this is surely a benefit to your organization, Thanks Monica, you rock!"
First time staying here hanging with the fellas and the hospitality is off the charts .. best bartender name Candace Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ¾.. Definitely recommend anybody that wanna stay n have a good time in downtown Atlanta to stay here !
Thx. so much for your comments. We've let our team know. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Please come back and stay with us again!
Overall my stay has been about average and the staff is friendly. As someone who travels for work - it blows my mind that hotels still 'charge' for WIFI. Especially a hotel that is situated in downtown near the convention center.
Anytime we head to Atlanta this is my preferred choice of lodging.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is classy.  Accommodations are luxurious. We stay here at least once a year for the Peachtree Road Race.
Better than expected. Nice place with great staff. Marsha was very friendly and helped to make our experience special. Breakfast was pretty good too. We overall had a good time there and would go back if we are ever in Atlanta again
"This place was great! The room was very clean. Complimentary breakfast, snacks, and drinks. Great staff! Close to everything. Free wifi. Valet parking. Great view. We would definitely stay here again!!"
"This hotel is beautiful. The rooms are huge and clean. Beds are comfortable. Room had a full kitchen. Great location in downtown Atlanta. Staff was wonderful, helpful and knowledgeable. CanÃ¢ÂÂt wait to go back."
"This hotels is located close to cobb centre, easy on/off access to interstate, The romm was very roomy, and nice. Close to shopping and restaraunts. 15-20 minutes to downtown. The hotel food was just okay, but over priced. I would stay here again."
"I will definitely stay here again,The hotel Staff was Super friendly and courteous,The Evening social was Great with Dinner and Drinks. Award winning Place to Stay.Loved the fireplace in the room,I needed it because it was snowing the week i was there."
"Nice friendly staff. Room was clean love the coffee bar and the fact that it has a fridge and microwave. Even though I had the Do not disturb sign on, housekeeping left fresh towels at my door which was awesome."
"Definitely not sound proof, people were going in and out of their room at all hours of the night and we heard every door slam"
"You have my sincerest apologies regarding your experience.  I hope this has not turned you away from the brand and you will give this property or any other Hyatt Place an opportunity to delight you.

Warmest Regards,"
"Rooms were clean and staff was professional and very nice. Slept well and had no problems.Conference rooms were comfortable.Food was good. Like the variety of food choices.Location was good, close to the airport and the free shuttle to and from the airport was very convenient."
My family had a really good time. The room was very clean and comfortable. The staff were nice always greeting us every time they saw us. The facilities were nice and the hotel looked very clean throughout.
"I stayed here because the Marriott was oversold and they put me in this hotel.  I was here for business, stayed for one night.  The room was big but old, the bedding is old.  I also killed 3 bugs. They need to exterminate."
"I'm glad our hotel worked out well for you.  For future stays, please know that we have a complimentary shuttle within a 3 mile radius of the hotel that give you access to many local restaurants!"
"The hotel is next to the GA Aquarium and walking distance to restaurants and other attractions. The hotel was clean, staff friendly, and was a good value. We were celebrating a Birthday in our family, and they worked with us to get adjoining rooms."
I loved my stay at Double Tree Suites and would recommend to anyone. The staff was very professional and went the extra mile to make me feel at home. I would definitely stay here again when in Atlanta.
"Needed a place to stay in Atlanta, wanted a nice clean place but had no family/friend referral, so turned to Hotel.com. Good experience, but even though we went thru Hotel.com, everyone refers to them as Trip Advisor, so confusing."
"Hotel was very nice, clean and comfortable Front desk staff was friendly and helpful at check in and check out
Only complaint was no breakfast on the weekends on the club floor. I've come to expect this"
"I am just checking out and I certainly enjoyed my stay.  The staff were so friendly, especially Simone and Jessica.  The room was very clean.  And, having experienced issues with parking lot security elsewhere in my travels, I appreciate the free gated parking."
"Unbelievable location, service is beyond accommodating and luxury hotel.  Plenty of dining (fine dining as well as casual) within walking distance."
I was there for the Food=Medicine Conference last November and thoroughly enjoyed not only the conference but also the in-house accommodations.  The desk staff were super accommodating...most pleasant to work with. I'd go there for future conferences any time I could!
The staff where the cream of the crop very friendly and attentive. Location was perfect for shopping didn't do much dining in the area.  Didn't get a chance to try breakfast. Wasn't empress by the room service menu and quality of the food.
"Loews Hotel in Atlanta - lovely hotel, good staff, very friendly and helpful.  
The rooms were spotless, the lobby was a busy and vibrant way to start the evening with drinks in one of the two bars, overall I loved this hotel."
Walking distance of all things necessary. Buckhead Theater was just down the st. Went to my first Caribou Coffee. Great area to jog too! People around the area were trying to stay fit. A lot of walkers and joggers.
"I live in the suburbs but I come here for a room when I know I should stay the night in the city. Whether booking it in advance or a last minute mobile phone app room reservations, I'm still yet to be disappointed."
"The Ritz Carlton is always an amazing experience.  The Buckhead Ritz is great for kids - a candy bar in the lobby, kids room service menu, fun pool, and upon request they will set up a camping tent the room."
"The only issue that we experienced during our stay was that the a/c unit was out during our entire stay to include our banquet event.  However, the staff were very accommodating to ensure that our experience was not a complete failure."
Great place staff waa very polite and the room was clean.  I would recommend this hotel to friends and family. I wa s there for a  wedding and I must say i was cery impressed  with my overall experience.
It was a very pleasant stay. Very comfortable room. Friendly staff and helpful. Convenient location to stores and restaurants.
This hotel is conveniently located right off the interstate.  It is a very clean and comfortable environment.  The staff is both professional and friendly.  We will definitely stay at this location the next time we travel to the Atlanta area.
Large two room balcony suites are large and comfortable. The room is a great value for the price. The bed was large and slept great. Internet service was more than adequate. The staff was friendly and very helpful.
"Love the location, right across from the aquarium. indoor pool was nice, and hot tub on the roof. 

We paid $30 for parking, but we had in/out privileges. We had a little issue going out though. 

Beds are comfortable, I would go here again."
"The website promotes a great Buckhead property but the property is run down and is in need of significant repairs and updates. For example,  the shower has mold; dirty carpet; small full size beds, tiny pillows, etc. I think I was in room 525."
"Sounds like you had a fantastic weekend with us, and weÃ¢ÂÂre glad you found our towels to be divinely fresh and comfy! Come back and see us in the next 6 months and weÃ¢ÂÂll give you an entire set of new towels to take home."
I don't even know where to begin this place was awesome. Beautiful hotel and easy to find! Amazing staff and clean rooms. We even had valet parking. Not to mention the breakfast! Best place to stay in Atlanta.
"Location is great, first time here, would definitely come back, was a little surprised at how quickly the team steps up together makes it extremely respectful, no request is to small, they truly want to earn your business"
Everyone was very helpful and the hotel was kept up nicely. They provided a shuttle to my company's office and had a great breakfast spread. The room was updated and very clean. It was centrally located and I would stay here again.
"Great time, nice upgrade for our room.  Grand daughter said was the best part of our trip to see the Nutcraker.  She ran around checking everything out in our room.  Even found a kitchen behind one door."
Enjoyed dinner with my family at social hour. . Connie was amazing. She  was exceptional and was very engaged with the patrons. Great service my plate or glass was never empty and she even made sure we had a welcome to Georgia!
The Wedton Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta has excellent amenities and service. My room was really nice and very clean and had an amazing view of the city! The staff is friendly and helpful. I'm very happy with my stay and would definitely go back.
"Everyone was so welcoming, polite and helpful.  My room was clean and quiet.  Food was very good-room service was on-time and the food was hot.  The location was perfect for any activities in Midtown.  I would definitely stay here again."
"The valet service and the baggage handlers,guest services workers were excellent! Want to say a special Thanks to Chris, Carter, Cody and Jonathan for making my stay there an Awesome experience. I would definitely stay there again."
"Clean hotel with friendly, helpful staff. Good location, conveniently located close to interstate. Fitness room was clean, but only had a couple of each equipment, so there was planning on my part for exercising.  Overall the experience was good."
"We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott downtown Atlanta, visit was very pleasant, from the valet guys to check-in.  I would recommend staying here.  Within walking distance to restaurants and the arenas."
"Hotel is a great location to downtown and many restaurants.  Next door to the new Mercedes Benz Field and Georgia Congress Center.  Centennial Olympic Park is across the street.  Staff is great, very friendly and pleasant.  Hotel room was great!"
"Our immediate family, plus many others, used the Conference Center for the perfect location between our Daughter's church (wedding), and the reception site.  The rooms were excellent, the food was terrific, and the staff was most helpful!"
"Room smelled musty and there was a wet spot in the carpet in front of the bathroom door that didn't dry the entire stay. Beds were okay, could use some firm pillows along with the feather pillows. Staff was friendly and helpful."
"This is the second time we've used this location for a work conference and I must say that the staff is very accommodating. I've dealt extensively with the concierge, Joan, and she has been nothing but accommodating and we can be quite demanding!"
Had a wonderful time at this hotel. They were very helpful and accommodating. The pool is lovely and has a nice view of Buckhead day or night. The lobby is posh. The restaurant at the hotel has great food.
"The Room was dirty.   Windows were disgusting.  The Shower stained, very nasty.   Only upside is very nice staff.   There are much better alternatives in Atlanta at equal or better prices.  I would not stay again."
I completed a detailed survey already. Everything was great except very long and slow lines in the Coffee SHop SUnday night. This couls have been fixed by having an additional staff person during what was apparantly a busy time between 10 and 10:30 pm
"The hotel is a standard W hotel, slightly outside the downtown area. But the hotel restaurant was abysmal. Every dish was poorly done, no taste, and they could not even prepare a simple dish (eggs Benedict). Terrible!"
We're so sorry your room experience was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlgh@hyatt.com to contact our managers about your stay.
I have even to my share of Embassy suites hotels and I have to say that this one was the best by far. Their breakfast is were way better then any other Embassy suites and their hotel staff was extremely helpful.
"Beautiful hotel in a wonderful location.  Although my wife and I only were there for two days, we found the accommodations, cleanliness, staff and service to be excellent!  We would recommend staying at this hotel to anyone who is visiting the Marietta, Georgia area"
"Van driver is a racist , hotel great location, front desk and restaurant staff are professional and very friendly. Valet Service top notch....food and drinks are tasty ...hard working employees....Van driver is a RACIST !!!!"
"Stayed at the Artmore for a work conference in March. The property is lovely and very comfortable. Breakfasts were great, customer service was perfect. Also, this property is centrally located and easy to get to from the train."
Great weekend getaway. Got a great room and an upgrade when I booked on-line. The valet personal were friendly and helpful as were the staff at the front desk. Room was awesome. Looked over Peachtree St at the Fabulous Fox Theater.
Visited Atlanta on business. Our stay was less than satisfactory. Room was not cleaned daily. Found the hotel to be generally dusty and dirty. Housekeeping not up to par. Found some staff helpful and others rude.
"This was our first trip to Atlanta and we didn't know exactly what to expect. The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean and a lot larger than expected! This hotel is absolutely stunning inside with a lot of accommodations"
"Love this hotel.. Everyone is so nice and helpful 
Andre Greer the concierge was awesome!!!
He was very helpful, nice, and gave 100% to make us feel welcome.
We loved our room and the food at Fandangles was great"
"Cashier was so rude, their was no parking. When we asked if there was additional parking somewhere we were told to just drive around u too the workers get off from work. The hotel is old and need updating."
The staff was friendly and the food was good both at the restaurant and at breakfast. WiFi was nothing special and the gym was very small and often crowded but a decent possibility to run outdoors. Nice spacious rooms so all in all quite nice.
Loved the breakfast and the modern amenities. Location was good for city activities. Parking is extremely expensive. Would skip the car rental and use taxi or uber service if we didnÃ¢ÂÂt have 2 car seats to lug around throughout.
"The Hyatt Place downtown has a friendly front desk crew and okay rooms... Ours was a little funky smelling and we had a hard time getting it resupplied with tissues and the like.  It is a great location, the parking works and it's fine."
My new favorite spot. I moved from another hotel to here and I was able to check in early. Front desk was professional and the room was clean. It was a little loud but was taken care of when I called the receptionist.
"Checking in hotel and when I come to my room found garbage at waste basket (used condom and used Auricle!!! See picture please.
Absolutely disgusting!!!! 

After long discussion with front desk got clean room with upgrade. 

But anyway, not acceptable error for 4**** hotel."
I enjoyed the hotel. It looked nice and was nice. The suite was very roomy. Even though we were right next to the door we never heard any noise or commotion from employees or customers. I will be staying at a Homewood Suites again.
My family and I stayed here for a week and it was home away from home. The staff were super helpful when asking for directions to get to some places. The rooms are spacious and very neat. Had a great time here
"Me and my family stayed at the Atl Marriott NW because it was 6 miles from the venue. The front desk staff was amazing as well as bar staff, breakfast staff and parking attendants. Side note they took great care of my mother as well."
Very clean hotel and the staff was very pleasant and professional. The front desk host even noticed it was my birthday and the staff signed a card and sent up delicious cheesecake. Would definitely stay here again!
"The room was prepared and the bed was very comfortable. The whole weekend staff was very courteous and friendly. The room service was quick. The wedding weekend staff was very prepared, check in was easy, breakfast was excellent and the hotel was very clean."
"The hotel's walls and floors were extremely thin, the downstairs guest complained about everything including us walking around the suite at night. When I was checking out I had a argument with the downstairs guest."
"Every time I visit Atlanta, I stay at the Sonesta! Lovely rooms, great environment, excellent customer service. Next time I come I to Atlanta. I will be staying here. The two bedroom suites are amazing."
This is a beautiful hotel with outstanding rooms and great staff.  The location was outstanding for a night on the town.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom room with our adult children and it was just perfect for our needs.
We stay here for business and enjoy eating at Martini's Restaurant inside Westin Hotel. Brandi is our favorite server and works hard to make sure her customers are happy. We look forward to coming back again.
"Walking distance to CDC very convenient 
Beautiful settings great conference room
Comfortable bed and pillows, clean bathroom, luxury lobby well decorated.  The most friendly staff that goes beyond  expectation to help you"
"Excellent hotel in down town Atlanta, social evenings Monday to Friday on the 2nd floor. Staff are wonderful. Manager  Christine especially helpful , my husband stayed at this hotel every month for almost 4 years and was treated like royalty."
Staff was extremely nice and helpful especially Shakil at the front with baggage. Clean and an overall wonderful place to stay. Location was amazing too. The hotel was within walking distance of the aquarium which was wonderful and really great restaurants.
"The Hyatt was the perfect hotel. Clean, great customer service and great value. I attended a wedding and the facility was perfect for it. The outside area, is perfect for pictures for the bride and groom and the inside layout was great."
"Great location, steps from the Aquarium, Olympic Park, CNN, World of Coke, Skyview and a variety of restaurants and more. Rooms were spacious, beautiful hotel, friendly staff. The daily free breakfast and happy hour were a great extra. We'd definitely stay here again."
"Hotel was nice.
Good room service.
Excellent shuttle service. 
Response was superb 
Nearby my office 
Overall it was nice stay in very good hotel.
Pleasant environment without any disturbances 
All necessary things are available in kitchen 
Happy to recommend"
"I went to this hotel for a business meeting.  It's in a very good location and I enjoyed my stay.  Its located right near a mall, within walking distance, so that was great!  The food was very good and the rooms were comfortable and clean."
Very Nice Hotel .. Area is very busy and construction going on behind the hotel which causes traffic nightmare.. but overall the room and the staff was very nice and price was great for the weekend rates
"The staff and accommodations at this Double Tree location, in the Atlanta GA area, continue to exceed my expectations.  The service is exceptional, the property is well maintained and clean, very secure, and the reservation and check-out experiences are excellent."
"Funky Hotel with nice amenities. Close to Aquarium. Easy drive from Airport and other attractions. Complimentary coffee, tea, water. Nice area for playing pool. Workout room small but nice and outdoor pool perfect for cooling off."
"I stayed at the Doubletree while attending training nearby.  The room was comfortable and clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful.  I'll stay here again on my next trip to Atlanta for training.  It was a great stay."
"Great stay for the price. Walking distance to many restaurants, museums, and other attractions. Clean and comfortable rooms and attrative lobby and bar. Near public transportation too. This was a great family friendly place."
I always enjoy staying here for my conference at the galleria. The rooms are always large and always clean.   The staff is very professional. There are lots of great restaurants close by.  Great views as well.
"My only regret was that we only booked for one night. Everything felt very modern and clean. The pool was great, the staff was friendly.

The ONLY thing I didn't like was paying for parking, but that's going to happen everywhere in downtown ATL."
"The Hotel was clean, the room was clean and the bed was so comfortable. The staff especially  Clinique Cook-Bay was so friendly and nice. The breakfast selection was wonderful and very clean. We will definitely  stay there again."
"It's rare that I get excited by a van ride BUT Jimmy Floyd my van driver, was over the top great. This charming delightful man just lit up my morning!! Thanks Jimmy. I always appreciate when somebody does things over the top!"
Our staff is proud of their customer service and would like to thank you letting them know you appreciated it. Your good review and your business are also appreciated. Thank you.
"The hotel is near the Marta stop and many places in Midtown. Staff were great and v friendly! During my stay, they were able to resolve an issue with the first room and took pride in their work!I would definitely return and stay here!"
Excellent location for the football game at the Mercedes Stadium...staff extremely helpful and made everything go smoothly. Will definitely stay there for future games. Location makes it easy walking distance to restaurants and downtown attractions.
Check-in was easy.  Nice apartment style rooms.  Large 2 queen bed suite.  Fireplace had instant burning log already included.  Walk in shower.  Did not have breakfast there.  Great room for $99/nt.
Good value for price - stayed for a conference. Food surprisingly good. Comfortable bed and linens - great staff. Not great location if your destination is downtown. Butts up against beautiful neighborhood.
"So comfortable, and a wonderful staff! Abdul was especially charming and friendly when delivering my room service.The pillows and bed were heaven, and the bathroom is really spacious. Plenty of room for all my girly stuff."
"The staff were some of the friendliest weÃ¢ÂÂve seen, everyone we encountered smiled and spoke to you and were very welcoming. Breakfast was very good and they really cater to their diners. Would definitely stay here again!"
"The Embassy Suites at Centennial Olympic park was more than Superb. The staff were all extremely kind and helpful in every scenario!
Their degree of excellence in every way was great and comforting to find. They make you feel right at home in every way."
"We loved the location!  We walked to the World of Coke, the Aquarium, the Skyview, and the College Football Hall of Fame as well as several places to eat.   The staff worked very hard to accommodate any requests we made."
"I stopped by the Embassy Suites before going to the braves game  and Charly was so friendly!!! Excellent bar tender!!

The hotel itself is clean and very convenient!

I highly recommend to locals and visitors!!

Ã¢ÂÂºÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¢ÂÂºÃ¢ÂÂº"
What a beautiful hotel and wonderful staff. The hotel club lounge was amazing as well - great service and food. The room was very clean and the service was fantastic. The front desk staff was professional and kind. We will be back!
"Your average JW marriott in an excellent location in Buckhead with walking distance from the Lenox Mall, True Food Kitchen and variety of shops & restaurants. Hotel itself is tough to find but overall would definitely stay here again."
"Rooms dated. Not as refined as it use to be. There are nicer rooms at other hotels--st regus, mandarin and AC.  We choose this one for the club level but that probably won't keep us there any longer. The RC buckhead needs updating."
"We love staying downtown Atlanta and we have found our ""forever"" place to stay.  From arrival to departure, all of the staff members were amazing.  Be sure you stay on the Concierge floor -- best for couples -- more value than cost."
"My family and I arrived at the hotel this weekend. The front desk staff were very friendly! We had valet parking, and the service was professional and prompt! The beds were soft and the room very clean and nice! I would certainly revisit this hotel!!"
This is by far one of my favorite hotels! Recent upgrades make it both more comfortable and beautiful than many hotels in any city! Staff is SUPERB!!! Restaurant and in-room dining are excellent as well!
"I stayed here on business for a conference.  I was impressed with the lobby area and rooms, but the adjacent ""Galleria"" was more than 3/4 vacant and the shops that were occupied were very pricey and the selection limited."
Lots to do and very convenient to walk to several places.  Good variety of restaurants and night life.  I recommend Whole World Theatre for some lively comedy.  For great Italian I recommend pasta da pulcinella
"This hotel was kind of a weird Homewood suites. It was obviously a old rundown residence inn. Looks like it was still in some form of remodel, but very old still. Bathrooms were extremely small and the room has a bad, musty smell."
I love this hotel! It is in a great location! Always clean and employees provide great service. We stay here for a few night and my only complaint is that they leave snack bar items all over the counters. Beds a wonderful!
"I got this hotel thru Priceline and was pleasantly surprised. The rooms are nice with good quality beds and the staff is great.
Only downside was the price of the parking. 

Location is very good with lots of restaurants and shops nearby."
The hotel restaurant/bar was the best part.We had a group and Brandii took great care of us while we were there for 2 nights in a row. She provided great service which made for a pair of enjoyable evening.
We had a great time. Great location. We were near an elevator so it was a little loud every now and then. Toilet ran randomly and was very loud. Shut the bathroom door and could still hear it. But staff was very nice and helpful.
"The hotel was very clean and centrally located. We were minutes from all of the attractions, Georgia Aquarium and World of Coca-Cola. We were also very close to good restaurants. The Valet Service was excellent!"
"Due to the weather, our flight to Atlanta was eventually cancelled, so we drove. Arriving at 5 am, we were met with a very friendly and accommodating staff. We decided to upgrade to the Club Level room and were glad we did!"
Very nice and spacious modern rooms. Nice complimentary breakfast and evening social. Nice indoor lap pool and exercise facility. A few good restaurants were located near by. Super close to airport. I will be staying here again when I return.
Nice clean room bigger then we expected comfortable bed's good place to rest up after a  day flying. Close to airport but very quit. Masive breakfast with good  and friendly helpfull staff. Next time we will return to this hotel
"Bar staff cares less, needs Queen beds,Much better value elsewhere in the Buckhead area. Just ok...overpriced for the room and service. For the price paid, you need to be on top of your game and facilities need to be up to date."
"hotel is the perfect location, everything I needed was unexpectedly close, I was thrilled, employees are incredibly kind and wonderful, the room was excellent, large, with big windows, great furniture, bathroom was nice designed"
Until all their renovations are completed I would recommend NOT staying here. Interior atrium completely ripped up and makeshift bar and restaurant are in bad shape. Difficult to find way around all the renovations and tarps and plastic hanging everywhere are terrible.
"Good location for what was needed. We chose this bc it was pet friendly. Hotel staff was ok, not very friendly.
request made at time of reservation weren't met. Kinda disappointed actually. Not sure if I will stay there again."
"From the moment my husband and I stepped through the beautiful glass doors, the customer service was exceptional! The hotel was chic, personnel were attentive, all were extremely helpful and continually spoke to us and with us throughout our stay. I cannot wait to return!"
"Maggiano's IHC was close.  Staff courteous attentive.  Shuttle drove me 2 blocks because it was raining. Restaurant, lounge, bar were active each day.  Other place to eat within walking distance, shoppes also.  Will stay here again and recommend."
"Very small rooms, disappointing. Decent lobby, but for the money, I'd recommend a 4 letter hotel down the street.  Over paying for location here. What's the deal with grass growing in the hallways? I was expecting sexy, I got frumpy."
"My husband and I recently stayed here.  It was wonderful. We'd had a long day of driving, so ordered room service.  Food was outstanding.  Room service for breakfast.  Also excellent.  The room was very comfortable.  We loved it!"
"Very comfortable hotel in a great area.  Parking is not cheap, but it is easy.  The hotel is chic, as the brand connotes, but is a nice place for all.  Desk staff is friendly and helpful.  All in all, a very good stay."
"I wouldn't ask for anything else from this hotel this hotel is amazing I don't know who own it but they have great employees, rooms, valet everything was perfect l love this hotel Ã°ÂÂÂ,great job I'm pleased"
Great place for both lunch and dinner! The Blackened Yellowfin Tuna is amazing. The chef (true Italian) is great. Service good. Great atmosphere and comfortable seating. Perfect location in Midtown near Georgia Tech.
"Not impressed at all for a Westin.  Rooms are average and smell of chemicals.  Morning coffee took forever to get ... should have self-serve like most good restaurants.  First breakfast order delivered wrong.  Bottom line, aging rooms, undisciplined service.  Go to Marriott or Ritz."
"It's a beautiful hotel but it's very dirty, the sheets were dirty with makeup and sex stains on them. They looked like they hadn't been changed before check in. Bugs in room, one was on me in the bed and killed two in the bathroom."
"Hotel facilities, service and staff were excellent!!!  Hotel staff was very friendly and engaging and I felt like I made some new friends.  This was a business trip and I would definitely return and take my family there to stay."
"Excellent hotel clean very nice staff. We used the shuttle to and from the ballpark both days a greats service.  Comfortable beds nice shower, close to ball park and shopping.  Would stay here again if came back for a baseball game."
"I can only say that the entire experience exceeded my expectations!!! The quality of customer service and their details in making sure every iota of your stay was perfect. When they say call them anytime, they mean it!"
"The best hotel in Cobb county. The only hotel I;ll like to stay at going forward when I visit Atlanta. The mall is only two minutes away. All the upscale hotels aren't even 5 mins away. My entire party love the hotel, staff and area."
"The beds were extremely uncomfortable. Everything else was OK. The service was good and everyone was helpful. It is in the heart of the action, which is it's strong suite. It would have been nice if they had a shuttle from the airport."
I love this hotel everything was great...Terry at the front desk check us in quickly he was sooo nice polite and professional he really should get promoted. My son enjoy the indoor pool and breakfast was awesome.
Michelle is everything!!!!!!!!!! She will give you life. Please give her a raise on everything.  The whole place is poppin and they got a pool l. She showed exceptional service to me during my entire stay
"Cleam and roomy corner King, 1455.  Clean quiet and very pleasant.  Any request promptly filled.
Good food, Rgency Club was very pleasant, market place food very good quality and value.

Special unexpected service touch after brief wait for room to be ready."
"Not the best Hyatt in the world and by US standards a bit disappointing really. Reasonable rooms but small bathroom, staff not that helpful which is very unusual for the US. Good choice of hotels in Atlanta so I won't being staying here again"
"We could not ask for a better stay. The room was very clean, quiet and had comfortable bedding. The staff was very attentive and courteous.  The hotel is well located and easy to get to. Very pleased and will be back."
Great value stay near the airport. The park and stay option and the shuttle to the airport (which runs every 30 minutes) were very convenient. We wanted something budget friendly near the airport. Double Tree did not disappoint- clean & comfortable!
Rude front desk service. Waited over an hour for shuttle to come then another hotel shuttle had to take me to the hotel. No washcloths had to wait to start my day until they could get some. Would never visit again.
"Had higher expectations based on past reviews. Older property, decor was hideous but the room was a good size. Free parking, decent indoor pool and hot tub. Limited breakfast options (yogurt, cereal, pancake maker) but included."
"Great location in regards to SunTrust Park. Only 14 minute walk.
Room was extremely clean and comfortable and breakast had a good variety. 
Would recommend to anyone who was visiting for a Braves game."
Excellent room and very courteous staff. Great business trip location. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Atlanta.  The value for the price is great.  The location close to the airport and downtown.
Stayed for a long weekend to attend a music festival. Super convenient for catching the Marta. Workout equipment was lacking. Both treadmills were not working. Staff was not very helpful. Would I choose to stay here again? Maybe.
"This hotel is beginning to show some age. Wall paper is peeling and hot water is almost non-existent in the early morning. It's in a prime, mid-town location that should have a higher quality facility."
"Very nice room with separate sitting area. Beds were very  Comfortable with high quality linens. Rooms were quiet, staff was helpful. Nice exercise room too. If it had been warmer out, the pool area looks great."
"Nice hotel good staff, clean, quite & safe. The rooms are embassy Suites sized. Ruth Chris is the breakfast spot for their fee breakfast. Very surprised & nice. Everything visitors want is near by. 
A return."
"The room was nice.  Especially the walk in shower.  Parking is ridiculous already so to charge $30 for valet and not get the valet service you would expect is outrageous.  Having been a valet before, their service would get 1 on the unifocus survey."
Very modern cool property!  Customer service was good and friendly. The meeting of 25 was excellent as was the food. Love the location so near to the airport. The outdoor patio is very enjoyable! The room is very clean and we liked the decor.
"Had a great experience, as always. Staff is always courteous,  friendly and very helpful. Rooms are large, clean and comfortable. Food in both the restaurant and the pub was excellent. FItness room was clean and well equipped. Great location with convenient shopping."
Our room was small but effective.  Parking is remote making checking in and leaving difficult.  It cost me a small fortune for tips to get our vehicle everyday. The personal were very helpful and friendly. There are limited dining facilities on site.
Omni Hotel is located in the heart of Atlanta and is one of the better hotels in Atlanta. The staff was professional and courtesy.  Check in was fast and efficient.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Omni Hotel in the CNN building.
"We do apologize for your unsatisfactory experience, this is not the culture we want to convey to our guest.  Please accept my sincerest apologies."
"I was greeted by a hostess name Michelle.  She helped me with a smooth check in as well as places I could visit while I was here visiting.  She was a great, happy and knowledgeable about the surroundings. I will visit this hotel again."
"432gretchen-

Enjoying your stay is always a positive! Hopefully we were able to address your issues during your stay here. Please feel to reach out to me if you would like to discuss further 678-460-3101. We look forward to seeing you again soon!"
I stayed here recently for a bridal dress shopping excursion with my younger cousin who is getting married next summer.  We had a wonderful experience at this hotel.  Service was impeccable and helped make an already memorable trip that much better!  Five stars!
"We spent two nights in this beautiful classic.  The rooms and staff were outstanding, as was the bar, equipped with lovely chandeliers.  Clean, convenient, and affordable, all things considered.  We'll stay there again!"
It was a great hotel with wonderful service and very clean. Everything aboit this place was wonderful. Would deffinantly recomend to anyone and will deffinantly be back our selves. Loved everything about it
"They have spacious rooms, many restaurants, and several department stores within walking distance. The free breakfast is great too, always fresh and delicious. The 24-hour kitchen in the lobby is awesome."
"Christi, we're so glad we could be of service during your stay. Thx. so much for your review. We're glad you enjoyed your time with us! Please come back and stay with us again, soon!"
Had a comfortable stay here. Room were great. Very comfortable bed. Had good sleep. Hotel is very large and disjointed. If you want a coffee or the bar it is a treck!  Parking  at 45 dollars is a total rip off!!
"Great facilities, clean, staff is very helpful. Proximity to expressways, shopping, and restaurants is excellent. Most are walking distance so you avoid driving with the challenging Atlanta drivers and traffic.  They provide all the needed items if you prefer to cook in your room."
My home away from home includes the best southern food breakfast! The staff is very friendly and help you as needed.  I would recommend to people who have business travel in ATL or for personal as well!
"The staff at the Westin Peachtree was awesome. Quick checkin and even better follow up after check in. Very willing to help with any need, information or access. The location is great near restaurants and businesses."
"Had to find a hospital close to Emory hospital. Great location,  free shuttle to and from hospital, very friendly accomodating staff, indoor pool and whirlpool, beautiful scenery and good dining options. Would highly recommend whether for business or pleasure."
"This hotel is excellent for the location location location.  Few blocks from Piedmont Park and midtown night life.  The hotel itself attracts a young hip crowd.  However, the rooms are a bit dated and hotel could use facelift."
"Not the newest hotel, but still in good condition. Showers have a lot of water pressure...almost painful water pressure. Decent fitness center and restaurant on site. Close to Dobbins and Lockheed Martin if you have business there."
"Friendly, courteous, eager to serve staff! 
Neat, clean hotel... Within walking distance to Suntrust Park. Shuttle driver was considerate, helpful and seemed ever-present.  Indoor pool was well-maintained but no kiddie pool. We will be back!"
"After a long travel day we just wanted to crash.  This hotel fit the bill with great service, a very good breakfast and also a nice kick-back bufet.   The shuttle was very convenient and service was great.  I always look for Drury Inns.!"
"Stayed here for a night, very close to the airport and many good restaurants at walking distance. Staff was nice you need to have a parking permit given to you at check in. Breakfast was good, fairly clean."
Quite a surprise. All new interior construction (was converted from an office building in the past year). Rooms are very clean and modern with an artsy touch. The staff was extremely friendly. The price was good.
"Really not happy paying $30.00 a night for parking and having to wait 20 minutes in the morning for the car because there is nobody there. For that price, you should provide better service.Most other hotels that charge for valet are not that expensive."
Staff was excellent breakfast was awesome location was perfect. If I have to travel to Atlanta again I will definitely have this hotel in mind. Right across the street from the aquarium makes the location awesome
"Blocks away from just about everything we wanted to see/visit. The hotel is new and the decor is impressive. The staff (everyone from the Valet to the cleaning staff) was polite, helpful, and downright a joy to interact with."
Wow. Stayed here several times and just canceling a weekend for next weekend.  Rude service of Dennis up at the front desk that will keep from me from returning. Stay at the Hampton one light down for free wifi and free breakfast. Would not return.
Excellent place in mid-town. Good lobby with nice bar. Rooms are clean and quite. Helpful and smiling staff. Excellent customer service. Walking to lots of restaurants. Around a block form Piedmont Park.
"Clean hotel 
Went there several times a year
It would be nice to once in a blue moon to get an upgrade, extremely rare in the Marriott, 
Don't know why
The hotel was fine nothing extraordinary
Will stay there again"
"This was a great place to stay, I had no problems.  Everything went well . I recommend this hotel and would love to book again.  Good scenery and nice ambiance. I have no complaints.  Located downtown and accessible."
I enjoyed my stay and will stay there during future visits. The staff was very professional and courteous and the room was very nice. The complimentary breakfast and evening reception were both awesome.
Walked past this building daily for many years after the file that gutted it. Was hoping it would get restored and glad to see that it has. All staff were friendly and helpful.  We will be staying here again.
I booked 23 rooms for my staff to work at a science conference. Having the extra space is great when sharing rooms and the evening reception is great for winding down at the end of the day. The free breakfast is an added bonus.
"Perfect location, great staff & just an all around great hotel! Take a look at this place whenever you are in the Buckhead area, you will not be disappointed. I will definitely be staying here again!!"
Was in Atlanta for the SNH 2018 conference and the hotel was within walking distance to the convention center.  Hotel staff was very helpful.  The elevators can be a little confusing at first but the security at the hotel was excellent.
"I was surprised to find that the room was superior to the downtown Sheraton. I liked the walk-in shower, full size couch, sink by the bar, decent sized refrigerator, and separate desk area. I would go back again if in town."
I was surprised by the extreme friendliness and attentiveness of every staff member we encountered. It was actually remarkable and my son and I commented to each other that we were surprised Hyatt was able to gather such a friendly crew.
"Michelle at the front desk was awesome. For her me and my family would come back. She helped us with tips on where to take the kids in the city, and all her recommendations were on point. Overall, service was excellent."
The hotel is brand new with 4 star rooms. John at the front desk is one of the finest front desk personnel I have met in 20 years of IHG travel. The hotel has everything you could want in a visit to downtown.
Everything about this hotel was a class act! Loved every person that I came in touch with was very friendly and professional. This was my first time staying at the Ritz and I would recommend it to anyone!
Excellent staff and service! Would stay again and reccomend. Asked for a microwave and they sent one to room. Asked for late checkout and was accommodated 1:30. Better than Hyatt regency! Very excellent
Excellent stay great staff from front of house to maid staff. Wonderful greeting from hotel GM. Parking was a bit of a challenge but was good. Food and room was great. Hotel surroundings were good as well. Wonderful atmosphere!
"Awesome service on every level. Great location where you can safely walk anywhere you want to downtown. Rooms are spacious and updated. Across the street from Marta, very close to I-75/85. Easy access."
Stayed at this hotel one a business trip for a conference. Hotel was clean and quiet.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Really like that I could open the sliding glass door to allow some fresh spring air into the room.
"Exceptional customer driven staff!!  Within walking distances to many areas of interest,  attractions, and restaurants. Great breakfast buffet.  Comfortable beds!!  Only draw back is valet parking only in outside lot for $34 a day!!"
Upper end classic Marriott with good rooms and bathrooms.  Traditional style overall.  It is adjacent to Lenox Square mall but is awkwardly situated and parking is on the high side.  Service levels good and the concierge lounge nicely delivered.
"Nice king bed in our room, I slept very well. Room service was great for breakfast...good coffee and the yogurt parfaits were delicious! Nice showers and great wifi! Quiet and very comfortable in a large room."
"To our guest hazimoto,

Thanks so much for the kind remarks!

We can't wait to welcome you back! Please let us know if we may be of assistance with planning.

I'll look forward to sharing your comments with both Ony and Marcus!

Best,

Michael"
Had a wonderful stay and weekend of Braves Baseball . Room was clean comfortable. Staff was very helpful and always greeted us by name. This is a delightful hotel and an reasonable price. Convently located to several attractions
"They gave away our Deluxe room I had booked,so ""upgraded"" us to a concierge level room. Smaller room.No separate tub/shower. Broken bathroom door. Uncomfortable bed. Pretty hotel. Book early for your ATL trip & stay at the Westin Downtown"
"This was a wonderful, comfortable, and safe place to feel at peace and get some rest. The area was clean, and you could go for a night swim as well as grill food, toast marshmellows, play pool and basketball."
"Helpful staff and nice friendly people. clean room, nice to have a shuttle can take for 5 miles around! I wish the internet in the room was good, but it's not bad when it on. The market has a good snack, try the local beer!"
It was a great visit. Great hotel! Every person we encountered was so friendly and accommodating. The rooms were clean and spacious. One of the better options in the downtown Atlanta area. Would totally recommend.
The hotel is not bad.  What sets this location apart form anything else is the attitude of the staff.  They are all friendly and helpful.  Really great people work here and they seem very proud to be there.
"Small bathroom  and room was dirty,I had to sleep on hairy sheets,the bathroom was also dirty. Not great for the money spent,please do your homework  before booking. HORRIBLE  Experience !!! Horribly  bad"
"Great hotel.  Marquis and the staff were professional, helpful and friendly. The room, hotel, and grounds were very clean.  They had an awesome breakfast that was well stocked and maintained.  The shuttle service is a big plus.  Will be back again."
My family and I were visiting Atlanta because my niece was graduating from law school.  The rooms were great!  They  very clean and extremely spacious.  The staff was super nice.  It is my new place to stay whenever visit Atlanta.
"We truly appreciate your comments and are so happy to hear that you enjoyed our hotel and look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thanks,"
Quick walk across pedestrian bridge to Braves stadium.  Mattresses are very lacking compared to other Marriott properties.  I could feel the springs all night.  Pool was enjoyed by kids.  Guests have many dining and shopping options within walking distance.
We had a delightful stay!! The level of service along with the quality of the rooms is unparalleled. Dinner at Bar Margot was delicious. At all times we felt special!  We will definitely stay here again.
From check-in to check-out the experience was excellent.  Staff were ready to assist.  Facilities were in perfect order.  It looked as if everything was brand new.  I felt welcomed and special because of their attention to every detail.
"The hotel was very clean and pleasant. The staff was excellent, friendly and polite. Very good place to stay for any kind of trip. The hotel was quiet as if we were the only ones there, but was fully booked."
"No complaints!  Great breakfast, clean room, nice gym, good wireless.  A little far from downtown Atlanta, but that was OK."
"As with all Four Seasons properties, the room was wonderful.The hotel staff is professional and courteous.Great room service and the little amenities like that newspaper hanging from your room door every morning."
"Clean, modern, trendy. Mattress are very firm which is not my preference. Lighting in rooms could be improved as well as availability of hot water for shower.Staff was very helpful. Plenty of parking. Location is great for downtown."
"Excellent location in the mix of it all. My daughter and I went for college visits, I will have to say one of the best hotels. The Architecture and the garden area in the center was relaxing in the evenings."
Top notch in every way. Very impressed and pleased. All around comfortable place to stay!  My husband was here on a business trip and my children and I tagalong.  We feel so welcomed and taken care of. I would definitely recommend this place!
The staff was outstanding.  They were helpful and were sincerely welcoming.  They have coffee and cucumber water in the lobby.  The location is very good.  The rooms are clean and modern with good linens.
The overall experience was excellent.  The only downfall was the poor quality of the bed.   The firmness selection did not work.  The bed had half that was completely collapsed and the other that was quite firm.   This made a decent nights sleep impossible.
"If you are coming to a braves game or just needing a getaway, this is a great choice. The people that work here are so friendly and the hotel is beautiful. Rooms all have a great view.  I will be back for sure!"
"We really like this hotel. It is conveniently located, the staff are always very friendly, and they have some great weekend rates. It is the third time we have stayed there. It is convenient to Hard Rock, Metro Diner, and other places."
"In my opinion, the Homewood Suites at the Atlanta Airport is the best of its type of hotel.  Clean, nice, affordable.  To a person, the staff was particularly friendly and helpful.  A really nice experience."
Nicely decorated downtown Atlanta hotel that is super quiet with EXCELLENT customer service and cozy beds.  It is close to many top rated  restaurants.  We never had to venture far. I would most certainly stay there again.
"I stayed here for Music Midtown, and it could not have been more convenient. The hotel is so close to Piedmont Park and is right in the heart of Midtown. The view from our room was great. The service was average."
My team had a wonderful time at our convention and staying at the Embassy Suites was just perfect. It fit our team perfectly and the complimentary breakfast and snacks and drinks was perfect in the afternoon.
"We will be contacting you directly.

Best Wishes."
"As I entered the  hotel,I was greeted with smiles and nothing less than great  customer service.  I would recommend this hotel over all other hotels that I  have stayed in previously. I look forward to returning to this particular location very soon."
We chose this hotel because of the convenience to the airport and for the complimentary breakfast and evening reception.  We were very satisfied with the Embassy Suites Hotel.  I would recommend this hotel to friends and family.  We will definitely be staying again.
"Extremely large rooms with ample space for our family of 5. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Walking distance to a few restaurants. Buffet breakfast was nothing spectacular, but the rooms and the friendliness of the staff made up for it."
We are glad to read that we provided you with such a relaxing atmosphere here at the Embassy Suites Hotel Atlanta Airport. Your review is greatly appreciated and we hope to see you again on you next visit to our area.
"Very nice, friendly people, clean, comfortable, smallish room with microwave and small refrigerator. Close to ATL airport but no aircraft noise.  Good free breakfast and evening reception (more than enough food for dinner) including 3 drinks per person (mixed drinks, wine, beer)."
"Our apologies for metro Atlanta parking. I assure you, our $30 per day is comparable in the city."
Great place to stay. We got the room with aquarium tickets! In walking distance to major attractions and restaurants. Room was clean and comfortable. Enjoyed breakfast with great selection of food and drinks.
"I have stayed at Embassy Suite for  several business trips. Each stay has been a wonderful experience. Service was great and Hotel was clean. I had a wonderful view of the Centennial Park. The hotel is walking distance from reasturants, and CNN Building."
"This hotel is at a Great location, close to shopping and restaurants. The hotel is older, the rooms and specially the bathrooms need remodeling, not every room had coffee maker, I had to ask for one.  Staff is very helpful and friendly."
One of my best experiences for hotel and conference.  Convenient.  Great local restaurants.  Breakfast great.  Restaurant in hotel great.  Staff friendly and helpful   Too notch facilities.  Hope to stay there again
"We spent a week here this summer with our three children seeing family and enjoying tourist sites in Atlanta. The Buckhead Ritz was a woderful property in a  great location, helpful staff and very good with children."
"Stayed here for a one night business trip and it was excellent. The room was super clean

Great staff and great hotel! Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Best hotel in Atlanta by far!!! Thanks for having me."
"Employees did not have a good understanding of how the breakfast plan works.  Also, the people working the desk could not give directions to museums that surround property.  More than just the manager on duty needs to know how the property works."
"Tonya and the staff were great. Everyone was friendly , smiling and a pleasure to meet. We ended the night with a few drinks in the bar , had great conversation with the bar tender and capped off a wonderful day."
"This hotel offers affordable, clean and comfortable options in a great location.  My room was spacious and the bed was comfortable.  The fitness center was modest, but the equipment worked and was updated.  Overall, this is a solid hotel at a very affordable rate."
Check in was terrible and took forever....only 1 terminal working. The sofa in room 301 had stains on it.  The breakfast was fair...we have seen better. Good location convenient to the interstate.  Parking could be improved.
Jasmine was excellent at providing us with everything we needed for our trip to Atlanta with the Home Depot she helped us with ideas of what to do and made sure we had everything we needed! Will most deff recommend !
"Rooms are decent, inside commodities are nice, pool was nice and mostly deserted. Wife and i did a long weekend trip there and was great for being centrally located. We walked to high museum and tons of other fun places."
Nice amenities and good price for a conference hotel.  This hotel was close to many great eating spots and some great late night hangouts.  4 blocks from a Publix so you could get anything you forgot at home.
"Excellent location, exceptionally clean hotel, staff very friendly. Walking distance to restaurants as well as Piedmont Park and botanical gardens. Suites spacious. Concierge service knowledgable. Great choice when in Atlanta!,"
We found all the staff at this hotel to be friendly and helpful!  Kind of nice when staff are engaged and happy. Felt welcomed and were satisfied in all aspects. Well done! Would definitely stay here if we are in the area again.
"Great place to stay!  The location is very close to the Georgia World Congress Center, Georgia Dome, Centennial Park, CNN, Omni,Georgia Aquarium, World of Coke.  Great food also is very closely by and the choices are very different."
Make sure everything is working when you check in.  The elevator was broken for 3 days during our stay.  Also make sure you are informed of their 100% satisfaction guarantee - I learned of this after our check out.
"Dirty and too expensive ,rude Woman in reception 
Very disappointed  do not go there , they prices is astronomic compare to even motel level 
Atlanta also very croud and dirty 

     Please pay attention 

      Cunsuler"
Everyone was exceptionally nice and friendly! Our room was comfortable and very clean. It was so convenient to walk to the aquarium and eating establishments. The pool area was very clean and there was plenty of seating around the pool.
"Nice clean hotel, great customer service. Enjoyed the 2 story suite with spiral staircase. Only wish they had complimentary breakfast for the price of they stay. Enjoyed our stay and will come back again."
"The staff at the Ritz Carlton are happy, friendly, and ready to assist in any way.  The food in the dining room was excellent.  The air conditioner in our room was not up to the task of cooling the room in the afternoon sun."
We are glad you enjoyed our breakfast variety and swimming pool! We always strive to provide a great guest experience. Come stay with us again soon!
"Spent four days while  attending a convention.  Room was spacious, comfortable and well equipped.  There is a good although small bar/restaurant.  Food was excellent.
Staff were all extremely friendly and helpful.  The location is great for waling, with a wealth of good restaurants nearby."
Top notch hotel. Convenient location. Clean. This hotel has it all. Prime meridian is a excellent restaurant. If I am  ever in Atlanta I would definitely stay here again. Bell staff was very courteous and helpful.
"We had our Family Reunion at this hotel for the Labor Day Weekend. Hotel Breakfast was one of the best i ever had.  They even made omelettes however you wanted it.  Also,  the complimentary water and cookies was a nice touch also."
"traveling through with granddaughter and the hotel was clean, safe and very welcoming.Front desk clerk was some welcoming and treated us very nicely.  Pool was great - having a indoor and outdoor pool was a nice treat as well as the hot tub."
"What a wonderful and friendly staff free parking great breakfast was included comfy beds with clean and organized rooms Internet worked great too 
Enjoyed our stay at the buckhead Hyatt close to all Atlanta attractions and mall"
"great stay, nice hotel, friendly staff, great location!  Gym was nice, pool area great, returant and bar provide good options.  I'd be happy to book another business trip here and will surely consider the Ritz"
"Beautiful property, well located with great views. Staff was extremely nice and very attentive to our needs. Convenient to the Shopping, restaurants and cultural activities. Our experience was wonderful and we will certainly return soon"
No Valet parking available. Hotel parking was $35 a day which they told me was a one time fee everytime you left and they dont care. Paid $70 for one night stay just in parking didnt offer any help!!!
Have stayed in much nicer luxury hotels. Renovations were noisy. We were not told if this until after checkin w/a message on our hotel phone. Room service very pricey. Room a bit small for a luxury hotel.
I forgot my toiletries bag which has some expensive stuff and my medication inside it and was told they didnÃ¢ÂÂt see anything in my room. I thought an hotel like Hyatt should be able to protect there customers and there properties
"Convenient location but parking was a pain.  Lobby too small to handle the breakfast crowd.  Not near enough seating.  Food was decent, but would appreciate soft drinks being included in the morning breakfast."
"We enjoyed our stay in the Omni as the location was awesome, the room was clean, the bed was insanely comfortable, and the staff was super nice. But, we found the $45/day to park was a little outrageous considering the hotel costs."
"I don't get to stay at Ritz Carltons often, but when I do I remember why they are on top. The service was phenomenal! Staff makes every guest feel special with personalized service. I will be staying again!"
Rooms are nothing special. Bed was terrible. Really needs to be replaced. Left hotel with little sleep and aching back. Hotel is in convenient location but IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure if I will stay there again. Beds make or break room.
"Have stayed at this Marriott several times on my trips to the city. It is an older hotel, has small rooms, but fits my needs. Always clean; guest services always professional. AC loud but otherwise no complaints. Will be back"
"This hotel was clean. Two pools.  My concerns were in the room. The bed was extremely hard and the air conditioning is on motion control. Woke several times hot. Also, breakfast buffet should have been included."
"Very very friendly staff (in all service jobs).  Interesting and attractive architecture. Great balcony view of the runways.  Decent room (albeit without robes included). Good beer selection and food.  Decent shuttle service.  Did I say, friendly staff?  Definitely worth some praise."
"The suite was beautiful, the evening staff where very friendly and helpful. However breakfast was horrible and taste old but we really loved that the kitchen was fully equipped with all the plates and  utensils."
"The hotel is getting tired and needs a refresh. Other than that, the employees of the hotel were very friendly and attentive. Had a snack in the bar which was good but the service from Brandi made the experience. Enjoy!"
Easy checkin to this beautiful hotel. Only stayed 1 night but everything was perfect and the staff was courteous and helpful. Room was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again next time we are in the area.
Slept like a baby. Our overall stay was nice. We were disappointed in the breakfast  food and the coffee was like water. Staff was awesome! Very informative. Whirlpool was nice and relaxing. We were happy to know it stays open until midnight!
"The hotel is within walking distance of the Georgia aquarium, the civil rights museum, the Coca-Cola museum, and Centennial Park. 15 minutes from the airport. Fabulous breakfast And happy hour. I definitely recommend this hotel. Fabulous staff"
The staff that we encountered were great. Room with view of the city and everything provided. Employees are very helpful and willing to assist. The hotel was beautiful and well maintained.Great place to stay.
We so appreciate your awesome comments about your family's recent stay with us. There are many great hotel choices in the Buckhead area and it is very nice to hear that choosing Hyatt Place was the right choice for you. Thank you!
"Not only can I recommend this hotel for the overall stay, but the pepeople made the difference to elevate my stay to perfection. The interactions I had with every team member made my stay one to remember."
"Before I arrived I called and spoke with Karla who was strategic in making our 1st visit to Atlanta successful. It was my daughter's 30th birthday trip and Karla's suggestions were great. Upon checkout, Carmen & Ruth were helpful as well."
Stayed in room 923 which had a dirty bathroom as well as ceiling coming down over the shower. Hair on the floor as well as dirty tub. Oh and the complimentary lotion was used up. This was quite an embarrassing place to say the least.
"Renovation was in progress, but the final product will be excellent.  Only negative was removal of in-room movie service...those were really nice to relax with after a full-day drive.  Staff is pleasant & willing to help."
"ok confidence can be relax smooth and comfortable for business trip or travel trip.
can be go to downtown for travel by marta train from airport. the traveler can be go to world of coca cola and georgia aquarium."
"Rooms had no refrigerator or microwave. Manager and staff were unaccommodating. Offered breakfast prior to contract, but once arrived, stated we had to pay for breakfast. Rooms with 2 beds were full size not queen!"
The manager Nickole was excellent. Very helpful and courteous. Helped with dining and made the trip comfortable. The support and cleaning staff was also very helpful. The location was very convenient. The morning staff was always willing to help.
The hotel staff was very friendly.  I really enjoyed the city view room I was upgraded to.  The suite was incredible.  The room was very clean and very inviting.  I really enjoyed my stay and I'm looking forward to returning.
"We stopped here on our way to Port Canaveral, FL and i just say im glad we did. Beautiful hotel, kids enjoyed the pool, helpful and friendly staff, and good breakfast! In addition to that, they have a really nice patio area."
Staff were friendly and welcoming. Nice location for dining options. Meeting rooms were comfortable and spacious (not too cold). The hotel restaurant was great for a quick bite before our meetings began.
"Very nice hotel, very accommodating.  A pleasant overnight stay. I would definitely recommend. Convenient location in Atlanta, close to many things.Can easily walk to restaurants, clubs, venues.  Easy to find and easy access to interstate."
Room was beautiful. Bathroom is amazing. It was very spacious and had extra amenities. Villa Christina breakfast Buffett was delicious. Parking is a little too expensive. Pool is very nice with very comfortable chairs.
"Great service, rooms and gathering spaces for a family wedding. Staff helpful with recommendations and service requests. Rooms had convenient amenities. Location convenient to restaurants, transportation and activities."
the hotel is a very short walk from the backhead train/subway stop (approximately a 40-minute ride from airport). there are various restaurants nearby. the lobby is attractive and the rooms are very nice. there is a large outdoor pool on the 3rd floor.
"I stayed there because the passport office is next door but its also close to peach tree center, post office Starbucks and several restaurants. The staff was very nice and understanding ...not just one person but everyone I met"
"Nice walkable location in midtown.  good restaurants nearby, Adriana, at the front desk was remarkable person.  She made reservations for us and solved a transportation issue we had with uber.  Great Job!"
This is a beautiful hotel near the airport. The grounds are beautiful with many flowers and flowering trees. My room was very nice and it appeared to have been recently undated. Common areas are very nice.
"Hotel is located right in the middle of the Battery, overlooking SunTrust Park, fantastic location for a Braves game or to enjoy the restaurants, bars and shops! Fabulous hotel, will definitely stay there again!"
"I was in town for a business conference,  the hotel and staff  were very nice. Room was clean and bed was very comfortable. The restaurant was affordable and the food really good.  I would bring my family back to stay there."
"Great stay and service, the staff did a wonderful job making our stay in Atlanta memorable. We met lifelong friends at a conference, the hotel went over and above to accommodate our gathering in regards insuring the experience was pleasant."
"This was our first trip to Atlanta and this hotel was recommended by our food tour guide.  It did not disappoint.  Entire staff, from front desk to parking valets, were so very friendly and helpful, and our room  was large and comfortable."
"Great experience! The hotel was quite, clean, and located close to downtown. The staff, Jemetris and Sharita, were extremely professional and courteous. I would highly recommend this hotel to those who want a great experience without overpaying."
"Only 3, easy to walk, blocks from Sun Trust Park.  Very clean rooms and quiet.  Small pool that could use some sprucing up.  Breakfast was o.k. for the money.  All in all we enjoyed our stay and will probably stay here again."
Couldn't find a better place to stay while attending sporting event in new football stadium. Easy walk to all attractions in downtown Atlanta. Hotel service staff very helpful and accommodating. Big city prices but fair in respect to others.
"Very nice hotel. Room very comfortable. Booking said I had an upgrade, but this never transpired. Enjoyed the room nonetheless. Love the window in the shower. Great view of the city.  Roof top bar and restaurant convenient and food selection. Very good."
"Hotel Staff were wonderful.  Very clean facility, great breakfast, room was immaculate. Great place to have drinks at night also.  Very relaxing atmosphere.  I will only stay there when I travel to Atlanta."
"Having wonderful time with families ate, talk, drink. slept long period of time. well, nothing much to talk now.  i had fun time in your hotel next time i will come again with my kids.  i need to go to see Atalanta attraction"
We received quality service from the moment we walked in the establishment. Everything was perfect and Samantha Harris displayed excellent customer service and great personality. I would recommend this hotel to other in the future.
I was there for a month.  It has improved massively from how it was a few years ago.  The wifi if fast and has good signal strength.  The front desk staff is now attentive and motivated.  The transportation runs on time.
"I think this is a good hotel for a short business stay.  Staff is fantastic, with a shuttle service within 3 miles that makes is easy to get to and from.  However the rooms needs some updating and a better fitness room."
old but well renovated facility. some things are missing in the room. but overall great value. clean and nice
"We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your room and found our service to be excellent.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon to visit the area attraction or for just a getaway.

Thank You,"
"The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the room are large and comfortable, clean and the beds were like sleeping on clouds. A great place to stay, really enjoyed the free parking, a rarity in hotel stays now, and the free breakfast was very good!"
"This hotels provides a clean, comfortable place to stay in the Buckhead area.  The furnishings are showing their age as is the room itself.  Beware of the parking charges. $25 to self park and $30 to valet."
"This is a great hotel very convenient and near to Atlanta International Airport. Resteraunt and bar are great and on off to main highway. Rooms are quite, clean  and well appointed. I will use this hotel in the future."
"Arrival was wonderful, the location is close to most of the convention events, the room was comfortable not elaborate clean but not new, elevators fast, could not extend my stay even 45 minutes, the view was average city view."
Our business group had their annual meeting here and the hotel was excellent.  We had cocktails/dinner around the outdoor pool area and it was ideal.  The conference facilities we're first class.  The rooms we're spacious and clean.
"I feel that for the price you have to pay to stay at this hotel, their should be better amenities for their guest.!!  A lot of the company policies SUCKS, but I guess that's the way it is in the corporate world..!!!"
"Was impressed from the minute we arrived. Friendly staff, clean, fresh style. The tram and close proximity to the airport was awesome to to catch an early flight the next morning. Loved the personal touch by displaying our name on the tv in our room."
"Spent one night prior to a business meeting the next day.  Rooms are fine. No coffee maker in the room (you have to request one). 

King room but shower was tiny and bathroom cramped overall. 

Staff were friendly and checking in and out was smooth."
"This is a fabulous hotel! Great amenities in the room, wonderful shower and very comfortable bed. Front desk staff were very professional throughout my stay. The shuttle driver was so nice and also very professional. Gorgeous Christmas decorations"
"I had to call the front desk on 2 separate occasions.  It was evident that housekeeping cleaned most of the room, however the toilet was dirty and clogged. 
The coffee was not replenished by housekeeping."
"Very nice hotel with a wonderful staff. The pool was closed during the Christmas break and I felt the hotel couldÃ¢ÂÂve offered a discount...they didnÃ¢ÂÂt.  Parking is $16 a night. Overall, a nice stay, but donÃ¢ÂÂt expect a discount for no reason!!!"
"Close to lots of great places. We were there for a trade show at Atlantasmart, and very convenient to walk to. Nearby park, with luminary show. City views are great from upper floors. Hot tub outside and weather allowed us to utilize it."
"Every touch point was excellent, from the front desk, the concierge, waiters, and servers.  I had the most marvelous time - the beds were so comfy and the bellman went above and beyond to ensure our comfort. I loved my stay!"
Great hotel.  Service exemplary.  Best location in Atlanta.  Rather expensive.  Restaurant and bar terribly expensive.  Had to get a mortgage to stay here.  Will not pay this much again.  Important business trip.
"It was very busy the weekend we stayed, but the hotel staff never appeared flustered or agitated in any way.  We were there for both business and pleasure and were completely satisfied this hotel with regards to both!  We will definitely stay here again!"
"We stayed here the week of July 4th. Even though the hotel was busy we had a seamless experience. Fresh hot breakfast every morning, free parking, and a free local shuttle. This was a great experience for me, my wife, and 4 kids!"
"Great stay, breakfast was hot, could use a little more variety.quiet and peaceful. Customer service was great, had trouble printing our city pass vouchers. Hotel staff helped and even had it routed to the office printer. Would definitely recommend"
"Not only are the accommodations first rate, (except for the bell hop), the price of the room is more than worth it because you are delivered to and picked up from events at the Cobb Energy Center.  Fantastic!"
"Good experience made great by the staff, sauna pool, clean rooms, delicious coffee, hot breakfast and free internet. We can say they wrote the book on Customer Service. Thank you Lloyd and LaToya - breakfast and front desk crew. See you again soon."
Enjoyed our stay very much.  We got extra special service from Robert at breakfast!  He went above and beyond.  Rooms were clean and neat!  I can't wait to come back.  We will be here next year at the same time.
"Great experience!  Desk staff was very pleasant and helpful.  Our room was very nice and very clean.  We especially enjoyed breakfast at Cassis.  Out server, Larry was exceptional!  He was attentive and personable and very prompt with service!"
"This hotel is an excellent  location for business in downtown Atlanta. The staff was wonderful; very helpful, attentive, and very personable!  The rooms were nice and the beds very comfortable! I will stay here next time I am in Atlanta."
"Lots of room. Great service and smiles from staff. Basketball, pool, billiards, complimentary breakfast. Full kitchen, with true ""separate"" room suites. My family is very comfy when staying here. Lots of restaurants and shopping close by this hotel."
The architecture of this conference center and hotel are amazing.  It's hard to believe that it's in the middle of Atlanta.  The meeting spaces are very nice.  The Wisteria Lanes Bowling alley is a fantastic venue for a small to medium party.
We are overjoyed that you enjoyed yourself while staying with us. We are looking forward to hosting you again whenever your travels brings you back to Atlanta!
"This is absolutely our favorite place to stay.  The service and amenities are amazing.  The pool area is wonderful.  It is clean.  The location is perfect.  Every year when we leave, we feel refreshed.  I highly recommend this hotel."
"The St Regis, Atlanta, is always a great girls get a way spot. The staff is so nice & helpful, especially, Steven at the front desk. They are very professional & always willing to bend over backwards."
"Everything excellent from registration to departure including the restaurant, business and service personnel. Parking was free and handily located including the luggage carriers.  The restaurant personnel were patient and helpful to include  help with tourist information."
"Thx. so much for your review, and for being our guest. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Please do come back and stay with us again, soon!"
"Beautiful facility in the city that feels like your out in the woods. 
Big windows that look out into tree tops.
Great facility! Beautiful rooms. Catering staff a little slow with the coffee for our meeting. 
Nicest, cleanest bathrooms I've seen in a while."
"Clean rooms, free parking, helpful staff and good breakfast what more do you need?  In the hub of Buckhead with lots to choose from near by.  Traffic not great in area and approx 20 min to Aquarium area so depends on what you are doing"
"Great place to stay, close to Emory. Hotel staff was great. Pool was refreshing and the Fitness room had up to date equipment. The cookies are the best and big and have no limit on how many you can get. Room was super quiet."
"Great room. Stayed overnight. Got in late from airport, called ahead and they checked us in and had room ready when we got there. no waiting...great!!! Very quiet room with nice view. Parking was a little complex."
"We always enjoy hearing from  our guests and would like to thank you for
posting such a pleasant review. We will be sure to let our staff know of your good review. Please return again soon."
"Great location in the midst of Buckhead - nicely appointed lobby.  The Presidential Suite is nicely sized with two bedrooms, but quite pricey.  Furniture and carpet are outdated.  Small fridge and microwave, no dishes/utensils, etc."
The hotel was extremely kid friendly. Traveled with 3 grandchildren. Rooms were comfortable and very clean. Staff everywhere welcoming and helpful. Breakfast servers were fabulous with grandchildren. Great visit to this hotel
The rooms smelled like wet dog it was not cleaned properly. The hotel was overbooked one of the managers was lost completely. They took or misplaced some of our belongings and still we didnÃ¢ÂÂt get any results on this matter. They also overcharged us
The room was clean and quiet even though it was booked because of all the events happening the weekend that we stayed. The complimentary cookies were so good. The customer service was so friendly and helpful. We had a great stay with absolutely no complaints.
Great stay. Great location.  Great staff. Love the area. We were on a date night with some friends.  Pleanty of restaurants and bars in the area. And the ferris wheel is in walking distance.  Rooms were clean and nicely furnished.
Staff was awesome and the hotel was very clean and nice location.  The front desk crew was awesome.  Gym a little small but overall nice place.  Breakfast was nice and the sitting area was very welcoming.
We're so very sorry to hear that your stay was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies.
"Great property, friendly staff, close to airport and eateries! Couldn't ask for more. Clean room, quite floor, great amenities, my overall experience was so good that I'd recommend this particular spot to everyone traveling to the area"
I was recently in Atlanta for a very important business conference. The staff and GM went above and beyond to make me feel at home. Beauty location and in walking distance to great food and attractions.
My Husband and I stayed  close to a concert venue for the night at the DoubleTree.  The Hotel was really pretty .  The rooms were very clean and it was quiet!  We would stay there again and recommend to others.  Nicely appointed rooms!
"This was the second stay at this location, the property is very nice and convenient to the airport.  The hot breakfast offers many choices and the complimentary evening snacks are a nice welcome for those checking in later in the day."
It is good to know you returned and enjoyed your stay again. All of us here would like to thank you for your good review and hope to see you again soon.
First time in Atlanta. I liked the area and perfectly located with a corridor leading to the Lenox Square Mall. Employees were very attentive. Room clean and confortable. Room service was nice. Needs soundproofing because you hear the trains go by all the time.
This is a GREAT hotel. The customer service is better than any hotel IÃ¢ÂÂve stayed in to date!!  Wonderful staff from check in to check out. The meeting rooms were amazing. The food was stellar. CouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have asked for more.
"Perfect and safe location for our family. Staff was helpful, quick & friendly. Our room was spacious, very clean and had everything we needed. The complimentary breakfast was great. Will definitely stay here again."
The hotel was being remodeled the hotel still functioned well with all the noise.The staff was great as always and very helpful.Stayed here a few times in the last year never a bad experience.Great breakfast as always.
"I like the location of this hotel, and the restaurant/bar. Good space to work or have a drink with friends, in your room or in the lobby. Real dishes and big fridge help out when you're there for a few days. Will stay again"
I was there for an office party the food was well done and the setting was very well done. The rooms where clean and had everything you needed. The staff was very helpful and kind. Overall the hotel was very well done.
"Jermaine Stanley served me and my team for lunch as we were staying here for a work event. He was fantastic, the food was great, and his energy was just what we needed to power through a long work day. 

Thanks!!"
"Great hotel in fantastic location.  Easy for us to get around to great food, and felt very safe walking from hotel.  Were able to eat out at fantastic restaurants close to the hotel each day.  Easy parking, safe area."
I really enjoyed my stay I would look for a Hyatt anytime I'm on vacation! The staff were friendly and the hotel was very clean not to mention a nice view. I received a nice discount just for signing up for there no cost membership.
"Nice people, nice property.  Rooms were clean and pleasant.  Parking is a bit steep, but then again you are in downtown or midtown or whatever Atlanta.  All in all, I would recommend this property.  Gym is nice as well."
"I needed a block of overflow hotel rooms last month when my host hotel sold out and couldn't accommodate additional sleeping rooms.  Shareena Rucker was flexible, helpful and a pleasure to work with throughout the entire process.  I could not have been more impressed!"
Staff was wonderful from check-in to check-out and all the way in between. Very clean hotel. Really comfortable beds and pillows. Well done. Very convenient to Battery Park/Braves stadium and Cumberland mall shopping. I could not have expected a better visit.
Every thing was great. Walking distance to shopping area with restaurants which was great to walk with family and grab dinner. We would definitely stay here again. We stayed one day as lay over on our way to Florida.
"We were at a conference at the Convention Center and the OMNI is attached to the Center. Good location, but our room was in need of an upgrade. Everything was a little Ã¢ÂÂwornÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂchipped bathtub, new carpet needed, etc. no magnifying mirror and no recycle bin."
"I liked this hotel because it had good quality and cooking supplies in the guest room. There is a microwave, knives and other cooking supplies. I highly recommend it. I hope to come to this hotel again sometime later."
The Hyatt was within walking distance of all the happenings downtown. Our room was clean and spacious. The staff were friendly. Breakfast was good. There was a nice patio area. I'd definitely stay here again.
Stayed for two days for a convention and front desk staff was very nice. Housekeeping did not clean our room. Only made the beds and did not leave clean towels and replenish cups for coffee. Convention space was awesome though.
Food was below part for such a high-priced hotel and coffee was so-so.  Nobody at the bar knows how to make a dirty martini.  The outside spot lights were aimed directly my room windows.  The complimentary wine was missing from my gift basket.
We love the pool and the views.  Lots of good restaurants in walking distance!  The staff is personable and always helpful.   ItÃ¢ÂÂs a great place to take a breather from the hustle and bustle.   A great place to rest and relax.
"This hotel has all the standard Embassy Suites conveniences, but does seem to be growing outdated as compared to some of the newer ES properties.  Still at nice stay, and a great location for business travelers or those needing quick access to the airport."
"The staff was very friendly. The room was awesome! It was well lit, very clean, and super comfortable bed. It's location was walking distance to where I needed to go. I would certainly stay here again if I come to Atlanta."
Overall very happy with our stay. The rooms are very spacious! Complimentary breakfast was good! Staff exceptionally pleasant and helpful. We would definitely stay at Hyatt Place Atlanta/Buckhead again which has a great location. Walkable to shops and restaurants.
This hotel is located at Centennial Park. Great view from room. Nice hotel. Good room service available 24 hours. Bed was super comfortable. Allowed for late check out. Getting here late (1am) made the walk from the MARTA station a bit dangerous.
I enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  The staff was exceptional and was very accommodating.  They had a shuttle that took you to several local restaurants which was helpful.  It was also close to the airport which made it very convenient.
"Everything good, except clerk checking me in left much to be worked on in Customer Service. Didn't mention Honors.  Chit chatting with customers before me, finally acknowledged I was waiting and then wanted to know what i want."
Loved the atmosphere and location the staff was very nice and accommodating  the room was outstanding the lobby was nice valet parking was quick couldn't ask for a better place to stay.  I will return in the near future
Hotel was average. Bar waitress was also emptying lobby trash and assisting with guest check in. Too much! I understand multi tasking but this was a bit much. All waitress talked about was getting off work.
Take it from me- you want to check in online vs talking to their less than friendly front desk. Everything else was on par with what you would expect from an Embassy Suites but check-in was extremely underwhelming.
"Hotel is on a quiet street in buckhead, nice breakfast and managers reception. Pool was nice, but the hot tub is too hot and a little uncomfortable. Will stay here again if visiting the buckhead area"
We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay with us. Please do come back and see us again!
Thx. so much for your review. We've passed your comments on to our team. We're glad you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope you'll come back and stay with us again!
We stayed at the Springhill Suites because of the location to my inalws. The hotel was beautiful and quiet. The breakfast buffet was healthy which was refreshing! The negative features were no notices about $22 overnight parking and unfriendly over night staff.
The Food and the Staff set this hotel apart from any other...... Every staff member has a can-do attitude.... they remember your name and never say 'no' to anything that you need addressing... ...... Food was 5*....Every dish that was prepared was well executed.
"The room quality wasn't great. The rooms could use some renovation, fresh linens, and an overall updated feel and look. The bed wasn't that comfortable either."
Always stay at the Georgian Terrace  hotel when we come to the Fox Theater. Easy and convient to food and Fox and other downtown Atlanta attractions. We have been doing this for years and we live on the north side of town. No other way!
"Bathroom did not smell fresh; fitness center outdated and lack equipment.  While maybe not important to other travelers, fitness center is important to me.  Been here numerous times because it is convenient to office location, but probably wont be enough to keep coming back."
"Staff was so friendly. Bed was extremely comfortable. I asked for toothpaste and received it immediately. However, they take $100 out of your credit card every night you stay in case you use the parking or eat the food in the room."
"This hotel was immaculate, friendly, accommodating, prompt to needs/requests, quiet, pet friendly, and in the middle of the action.  Walking distance to restaurants, theaters, coffee shops, attractions, etc. Very pricey, but it was a special occasion. Definitely will stay again."
"Check in and room service are quick, the airport shuttle runs every 15 minutes. The whirlpool was out of order, but not a huge deal. Bed was comfortable, the entertainment systems do not have chrome cast available. Solid choice for a layover."
Had an extended stay here for son's baseball tournament. This was an excellent location. Close to lots of shopping and restaurants. My daughter  and I were staying alone and felt very safe and comfortable. Will def stay here again when in the ATL area.
I usually enjoy the Double Tree brand but not this time.  The room was fine and clean BUT the customer service was terrible.  The staff will not go out of their way to treat you like a real person.  I will NOT stay here again.
"Amazing time, the room and view of downtown atlanta was beautiful, and the staff for the conference rooms were so friendly. the food provided for us was beyond delicious, would definitely stay here again"
"Checked in early with no problem.  Great view on 22nd floor.  It was very convenient to the aquarium and world of Coke.  It was very busy lots of conventions.  Room very nice and beds comfortable.  Shower head not so good, hard to wash hair."
Great property to stay at if you are ever in the Atlanta area. The staff there is amazing!! And I can't forget about the beautiful view of the city. It's not too far from all of the attractions. I will definitely visit again.
"Nice, clean, friendly hotel. Stayed there for weekend birthday getaway. Good location. The bar was nice as well. Room was spacious and bed really comfortable. Indoor pool looked inviting but did not go in it. I would stay here again."
"Nice re-molded hotel.  Only negative is the pool was overcrowded with kids. There were several children unsupervised and no pool attendant.  There were no pool towels, when I called the front desk it took about 1hr. before someone came with them."
"No maid service, everything was open, no remote control for the t.v. Young lady at the the desk nasty(Indian lady) dirty towels, trash was not taking out, hallway smelled like wet dog, pool not clean"
Cleanliness was just okay. Room had teach left from previous traveler. Staff was not very friendly. Shower didnÃ¢ÂÂt drain. Pool area was not maintained. IÃ¢ÂÂm an avid fan of Country Inn however not a fan of this location.
"Phenemonal anniversary weekend getaway.  Hotel was beautiful, modern, clean, and the room was exquisitely comfortable. The hotel is down the street from lots of shops and restaurants.   Will definitely return."
"Thx. so much for your comments. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay during the conference, and that you could enjoy our dining and local attractions. We hope you'll come back again!"
Calvin is the best bartender ever. He makes great drinks like this blueberry mojito concoction. He made our stay enjoyable and well refreshed. He is currently making me a raspberry mojito that he says i am going to be the guinea pig for. Oink.
"My stay was great!!! I had a wonderful time. Can't wait until my next stay!! The staff was very professional and accommodating.  Cleaning staff didn't hesitate to clean my room while we were in the room. Great, Great, Great!!"
Hotel is newly renovated so clean and nice. Located in Buckhead close to great shopping and dining options. Only negative was too few cable options. Ok if you like ESPN. Remember women travel too. Restaurant on site was convenient with nice staff.
"Thx. so much for your review, and for being our guest. We're so glad you were able to use our complementary shuttle to enjoy our great Buckhead neighborhood. Please come back and stay with us again the next time you're in town!"
"Mandarin Oriental is my second home; and I have been in many;Miami, San Francisco, New York, Atlanta, Barcelona, Geneve, London and Prague.All of them in the VERY BEST LOCATION
The highest level of service, silent, warm and welcoming.Everyone there seems to be your personal butler"
"Thx. so much for being our guest. We're so glad you could be with us during the holidays, and that you and your family enjoyed your stay with us. Please come back and stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead."
"Good hotel, good price for area.  Free breakfast and drinks in evening.  Nice staff.  Hotel recently redone.  More modern looking.  disappointed with workmanship in the room  Sure seems like it would have been better quality"
"Nice facility. The hotel staff is wonderful, they work very hard to make sure your stay is pleasurable.  Clean rooms.  Slight difficulty getting  into parking lot could use more signs noting parking areas.  Would stay there again."
"This was one of the best stays EVER! The 3 bed 2 bath was beautiful, the staff was so accommodating, the valet staff were so helpful and the hotel brunch was delicious! We stayed Friday night and Saturday night and would definitely refer this hotel!"
"Great hotel,  location and staff.    Very clean spacious rooms.   Pool and Hot tub area great.  Even had fire pit with plenty of seating around it.    Complimentary coffee and cookies in lobby.    Friendly staff and valet was quick and efficient."
"My husband and I choose your facility every time we visit our son and his wife in Atlanta. Everything is consistently pleasant. The facility is beautiful, the service is impeccable and every employee we have ever encountered is cheerful and helpful."
We are glad to read you had a good stay here with us and would like to thank you for your good review. Please return again.
"My stay was pleasant., started with a beautiful building, then the front desk person mr. steward was very helpful with the type of room I preferred, and Ryan also was very helpful and professional.
I'd prefer this midtown location any day over the downtown locations."
"The room was very spacious and quiet.  There is a morning buffet that has excellent choices, but kind of pricey.  The overall layout and feel of the hotel us well done.  Great pool area that is enclosed.  Overall nice stay."
"The Embassy Suites continues to provide first rate accomodations in downtown Atlanta.  The suites are very nicely furnished, staff is very professional, and the hotel overall is excellent.  THeir is a Ruth Chris steakhouse and a Starbucks inside which is very convenient."
Stairs are far they stop at 3rd floor outside access around the building elevators slow only 4 with 16 floors holding a pageant staff rude they over charge for room and parking there not many parking spots no internet access pool area dirty
Hallway and rooms had a musty smell.  Rooms and bathrooms were small.  DonÃ¢ÂÂt stay here if your arenÃ¢ÂÂt comfortable changing in front of your travel party.  Also if you are large statured bathrooms have little room to move
"Everything was great, close to Interstate highway, shopping, restaurants, etc., the bedding was exceptional and very comfortable. Free internet access was great, the speed of internet was good. The staff was very friendly, the hotel is very clean and safe."
This was our 4th visit to The Westin Buckhead and we were not disappointed.  A shout out to Mike T. who took great care of us at check-in.  We will definitely be staying at the Westin Buckhead on our next visit to Atlanta!
The service is number one...everyone that worked for marriott was smooth and calm no matter what the request was....i will return and i will make sure my friends visit the JW i the near future as well THANKS!
"Very clean and comfortable, while being located near excellent, medium-priced restaurants and major shopping areas.  Access to major local interstate system is very convenient without the noise from the traffic being intrusive."
"Starwood hotels have the worst beds and pillows.  The mattress and pillows were so uncomfortable, I checked out early. Also,the hotel staff was extremely noisy. They were slamming doors at 8:00 in the morning. I will never return to a Starwood hotel again."
"Paid parking was not communicated. There was none at the bell counter. When confronted the question was ""Did you inform that you had a car?"" Wow!!! This is one arrogant staff  No complimentary breakfast. Everything has additional charge!! Innovative way to fleece customers!"
"You rock and we are so happy you enjoyed your stay here at W Atlanta-Buckhead!  The MARTA transit stop is literally half a block away from our hotel, which helps for very convenient transportation to the airport!"
"Nicely kept and decorated small hotel.  Across street from Marta station. Off site parking costs extra $$.  Best to leave car at home and use ride share or Marta.  Quiet rooms, friendly staff. Breakfast $10 buffet is ok.  Overall a good place to stay."
Staff were very friendly and the rooms were very nice. Everything was available right at your finger tips.....shuttle service available as well as Starbucks and a restaurant on site. The location is perfect!
"Stayed at the Hyatt for the Peachtree Road race. Excellent room, staff, and overall accommodations. I would highly recommend this location and definitely intend to stay there again for future visits to the area."
"We were here for a work conference with over 200 people! Everyone was courteous, helpful and just amazing, the owners should be happy with the staff they have. I would recommend this hotel to my family and friends."
Spent Saturday get away at hotel and it was great!! As soon as we arrived they took really good care of us and anything we needed.  Room was very nice corner room on 17th floor.  We ate Sunday brunch which was great. Will stay again!!!
I was moved here as the hotel I booked oversold.  It looks new but all of the staff are wonderful.  Thank you as you turned a bad situation into an awesome one!!  Next time I will book here instead of wasting time with your competitor.
"My most recent stay was absolute UN-impressive! A lot of attention to detail by this property staff was missed due to the lack of being properly staffed. Want a phone call returned by the Front desk, Assistant GM or GM???-FORGET  IT!!"
"The front desk staff was pretty unwelcoming and not too friendly. They sometimes seemed bothered when approached. Embassy Suites is usually my hotel of choice, but I would probably not stay at this location again."
Woke up to no hot water in morning of departure and no offer to make it right!  The swans in the atrium also add an odd smell to the whole hotel.  Will not be staying here again unless I absolutely have too!
Very pleased with quality and staff. Enjoyed the warm cookies served during check in. The hotel bartender was friendly when serving our drinks. Cleanliness of room was great every time we entered. The overall price of stay was a little expensive.
"It really needs to reflect better how extensive the construction is when you are booking the place. It will hopefully be nice after, because right now it is a crazy place to stay. The staff was very helpful and nice though."
"This hotel is about a five minute walk from the aquarium and the coke museum.  It has restaurants within and nearby, including the CNN food court. There is a bit of a run down outdoor pool and hot tub. Staff was very friendly and helpful."
"Really appreciate your review, thanks for letting us know your thoughts and are currently working on our  Capital planning for the future.

all the best !!"
"Excellent for families or an extended stay for business.  Rooms are very spacious, clean & comfortable.  Kitchens well appointed with dishes & utensils.  Free breakfast available.  The pool is small but adequate."
"Too much attitude at the front desk from the ladies working there.  Customer service sucks.  

Valet and bartender are excellent.  Lively bar and great seating area outside.  Close to great restaurants like Rays!  Clean hotel. Great location."
"The room was awesome it will definitely be my number one getaway for couples . The bathroom was immaculate, customer service wasvgreat, they also have a lot of complimentary things they do, like mojito at check in for free."
"this was a lovely hotel!  the staff was very personable and friendly.  The breakfast was excellent.
The room and all amenities were clean!  Yes, I'll stay there again!"
Hotel staff was very helpful with an easy check-in and check-out process.  The room was quiet and clean.  Breakfast was very good with a very friendly server.  The hotel facilities was conveniently located close to the interstate and seem safe and secure.
"The hotel is located near lots of stuff within walking distance. They even offer a shuttle within a one mile radius. The whole place even the business center smells like dog.
Other wise the place is ok"
"My stay at the Sheraton Suites Galleria in Atlanta was a great experience.  My room was clean and spacious.  The service was great, and it was very within walking distance to the Cobb Galleria Conference Center and the Cumberland Mall."
My family and I did a quick weekend getaway. The hotel was priced reasonably. Our room was nice and clean. Customer Service was great as well. Only complaint I have is there was not a microwave or mini fridge available in the room.
This hotel is beautiful. Check in was fast. Our rooms were clean and beds.  comfortable. We felt safe at all times. Its very close to Cumberland Mall for shopping. There are some great restaurants and after hour spots. We enjoyed our stay
I have come this particular location for over 10 years now. i love this place and always recommend  first. I make sure i book with Sabrina because she is very attentive and makes sure im booked properly.
very well run and quiet house. great service friendly staff. good food. nice amenities. salt water pool and hot tub. close to midtown attractions and restaurants. parking added to your with option for in and out.
The Location and Hotel were perfect for our visit to the new Atlanta Stadium. The MARTA Station was only two blocks from the Hotel. The street noise on Peachtree Road was a slight problem in sleeping.
Hotel under renovation. No restaurant area. A make shift area for breakfast that was freezing cold due to construction. Lobby was a mess. Wires hanging and plywood. Two chairs in lobby. Not the friendliest hotel staff. Would not return
Enjoyed my stay and it was conveniently located to the airport! There are other hotels in the area but this one was worth it as far as price and value. It's clean and looks very new. I would stay here anytime!
"This hotel is amazing. The hotel and Ruth Chris staff is very professional and accommodating. The complimentary breakfast is awesome. Location is perfect for all ages, my 4 yo did not want to leave. I absolutely love this hotel."
"We stayed here for a basketball tournment and the staff was very professional and was always will to help. Our was clean and fresh,and a nice location right off the highway with plenty of restaurants around. Would stay again"
"The hotel itself is lovely and the suite was very clean. I stayed on the 5th floor and the lady who cleaned the room was great. I also enjoyed the complimentary breakfast, parking and internet. The evening social was great."
A dazzlingly beautiful hotel. Convenient location to my business meetings at GP Center. My room was clean and cool. The layout was easy to navigate. All employees were extremely helpful. I would stay here again.
"Great location. Empire State south restaurant/bar next door- over the top delicious food!  
Hyatt staff throughout very very sweet. Great people at valet and hotel maintenance - professional front desk experience too."
"My stay was great with the exception of the mandatory valet parking. There was no other option and this was not a complimentary service. I already paid to stay in the hotel, then I was charged a daily ($12)  parking fee too."
Love embassy suites for the 2 room suites standard. Only negative is the on premise restaurant Ruth Chris. Traveling on per diem that is not the place i would eat at. Usually like to eat at hotel for convenience but not possible every night.
Nice staff I just couldn't stay the night the rooms smelled musty and stale ....the first one was bad and the second on was unbearable so I checked out and left....I have no idea how management doesn't address this
"Front desk is so nice to all guests.  The manager Shakita is friendly and willing to help with all issues. A good hotel to stay.  If you have to stay in the area of the airport, it is a good place to go."
Complimentary shuttle to Brookhaven MARTA Station . close to a few fast food resturants within walkimg distance . along the local bus route conecting from the trainthia is agreat t of the way locaion. breakfast is not included with the hotel rate
"Excellent hotel, exceptional staff, amenities and turndown service! Atlanta. Great bell staff, professional  front desk. I would definitely recommend the Mandarin, I'm looking forward to my next trip!!"
This brand new property is a great location for doing business in Perimeter Ashwood/Dunwoody.  Staff was extremely professional and polite. The room was large and very comfortable.  Breakfast was also very good. I would not hesitate recommending it.
Thx. so much for your comments. We've passed your review on to our team. So glad you enjoyed much of your stay with us. Hope you'll choose us again the next time you're in town!
Good hotel! It was just very out dated. Construction was going on but that was fine. Definitely worth the price and it is not even 5 minutes away from the airport. Wouldn't stay again but I enjoyed it.
"Excellent location! Polite, courteous, friendly, accommodating and professional staff all around from valet to check-in desk! Room was beautiful, amazing view of downtown, clean, exceeded our expectations! My family and I really enjoyed our overnight stay at Loews! Would definitely stay here again!"
"We truly appreciate all your wonderful comments and are so happy that our team made you feel welcome and that you could be yourself.  We truly look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thank you,"
Orkin pest control and our housekeeping staff check for such regularily.  Room has been treated and inspected by Orkin.
Staff were exceptional. The valet was friendly on arrival. The room was comfortable. Digital check in was seamless! I enjoyed breakfast which was reasonably priced and served fresh and hot! Excellent service! This will be my new home in Atlanta!
Love this hotel!  The staff was awesome!  They helped with last minuted details for our event and made it work!  We will be back next year.  I would stay at this hotel for pleasure as it was a great location.
"There was a leak in the shower but except that everything was clean and comfy. No bad odors in pillows , towels and room in general. Very cool decor in rooms and hotel in general. Very good location ."
"Stayed here last weekend. Great hotel, staff is very friendly, and room was excellent.  Did not care for the breakfast charge buffet charges.  We ate elsewhere.  Very close to mall and lots of restaurants."
"Amazing service!  Must try the Sunday brunch and go to the spa! From the valet to check in, room service and the beautiful room.  All was perfect and efficient.  The spa is amazing and we will definitely be coming back!"
"Great location for Braves games. Great updated hotel rooms. Bed was extremely comfortable. 
Curtains kept the room dark. Nice bathroom and shower. 
Room was supposed to have two free bottles of water, but didn't. Only 2 bottles available for purchase at $6.00 each!!!!"
I spent 3 nights here a few weeks ago. Accommodations were good. Service and cleanliness were good. I did experience loud neighbors which ruined 1 night of sleep. Internet worked well. Bar was average. Food was run of the mill buffet style at lunch.
"I'm a hotel snob and lover of all things starwood. This hotel knocks all others out of the water, even edging on the St. Regis in Rome.  Although I used points, the experience was truly priceless.  I hope this is what heaven looks like."
"Stayed here on recent visit. The hotel is a 5 star and not surprised #1 in Atlanta. The service and amenities are excellent. very beautiful and elegant room. Nice size and very comfy bed!  Excellent hotel restaurant and gym. Top notch pool, etc."
The hotel was great. The service was amazing. There are a lot of floors so at times the wait for the elevator was 10-15 mins. But otherwise it was a pleasure. Right in the mix of everything and super close to Marta
"Great location and excellent accommodations.  It is close in proximity to Georgia Tech, the MARTA train station and Piedmont Park.  We have made previous visits to this hotel and if in the area, I would definitely visit and stay again."
"Great location and very nice staff.  Rooms are comfortable, and a nice selection of eateries.  Hotel alittle too big, which also allows for much foot traffic.  DidnÃ¢ÂÂt find the main hallways very clean, but room was immaculate."
Generally a great place and location. Breakfast selection and staff were excellent. The lobby was attractive and comfortable.Some of the dial comfort mattresses function poorly.  Be careful #no room 210
This is a superb hotel in a downtown Atlanta.  Very nice accommodations and courteous agents.  Good restaurants.  Great views of the city from the restaurant on the top of this hotel.  One block away from The subway station and multiple restaurants.
Hyatt House never disappoints. The suites are spacious and well maintained. Nice amenities that lend to a very comfortable experience.  Staff is always friendly and accommodating.   Makes for a great gathering spot or quick family staycation.
"This is an exceptional property with a fantastic staff. Strongly recommend the Club floor because off the staff. They remember all their guest by name, your preferences, in my case my family. Minka in particular makes this hotel a home away from home."
"We recommend this Hotel friendly and professional employees,clean rooms,Breakfast was very good. We will stay here the next time we are in Atlanta. Close to highway,restaurants, shops. The hotel is very nice,clean and the employees are all wonderful individuals. Thanks for a great time."
Excellent staff and hotel is conveniently located in downtown Atlanta. I will stay here again.  Only concern is the valet parking is $38 a night.  Public parking right across the street is much less.  Live and learn.
"Love this place, everyone is so hospitable and genuinely wants you to enjoy your stay. Karl, our complimentary driver, was particularly awesome and suggested a fantastic restaurant and gave us complimentary drinks to the wet bar. Which was also amazing. Fantastic place."
Moving our adult child to Emory and this was a great base location to explore living options and enjoy dining and shopping within walking distance.  The staff was so very friendly and helpful!  Everyone smiled and greeted us.
Will stay again. Excellent service. Clean rooms. Easy to find. Good food. Room was big. Great customer service. Nice pool. Parking was okay. No noise. Nice full kitchen. Nice bathroom. Overall great experience.
"We stayed for 4 days, really nice place. Around 15 mins for downtown Atlanta. Great staff, especially Jean, who helped us start our car battery when it was really cold. Room were smaller than expected though. Good stay."
"It was great hosting you , GO PACKERS"
"From front desk to room attendants ,very friendly, remembered my name. Service excellent. Would definitely book again when in Atlanta. Here June 29th to July 5th.  Jennifer at front desk and Inge waitress were wonderful."
Arrived to check in at 3:30 PM and had to wait for available rooms. finally issues room and was placed in handicap accessible room with 2 double beds. requested 1 king and non handicap. water in room was inconsistent temps and cold half the time
"Pretty clean, but lacking HH Honors benefits, mediocre service, mediocre food and several issues that were annoying, especially for a property that was recently renovated. There are better choices in the area."
"Service is impeccable, room was beautiful and location is ideal for my business needs.  Bellman on the morning of my leave was friendly, helpful and overall a delight to interact with.  Additionally, my room service late lunch was delicious.  I will return in the fall!"
Escaping Hurrican needed pet friendly hotel in Atlanta. Great location-great value and very nice rooms. As a former traveling salesman the carts are the best big wheels and solid. Also walking distance to Bones need I say more!!!
The front desk meaning Ms.Dorsey could have shown a little more empathy it's a a part of giving good customer service.
Paid for a room in advance and they sold it out from under us.  Do not stay here if you actually want a place to sleep.  We booked weeks in advance nd because they overbooked they sold our room to someone else.
I just felt the staff was very rude. They never greeted you when you came in door. I had to ask where the elevators were. It was like I was bothering them to ask a question or to get checked in. Need better staff.
"My room was clean. Staff was more than helpful. Location was prime! AC the front desk attendant is lovely. Convenient to shopping, nightlife, and downtown where I was headed for Volleyball. Would definitely stay here again."
"Over charging abounded, erroneous charges ($225.01) to my Chase Visa Debit chard. Misleading gratuity and to go fee was added to my breakfast order at the SALTWOOD TAVERN, rendering my $5.00 tip unnecessary and inappropriate."
"Located in the middle of Centennial Park and walking distance to more than a half dozen points of interest.  Outstanding service, helpful and friendly staff, complimentary breakfast and reception and nice pool. Great for the whole family."
"I'm not sure how every day is there, but my stay was excellent. The rooms and facility, in general, were exceptional. The staff at all levels was top-notch; excellent customer service. My family enjoyed Saltwood as well."
Exceptional customer service with perfect patio view. Centrally located downtown close to Mercedes Benz Dome. Would come back for another visit. Went for Beyonce and JayZ Concert. Able to walk to places I needed nearby.
"Rooms were outdated,  very hot,  couldn't get air conditioning working, didn't offer another room.  Airport service awful,  told us the wrong place to wait,  ended up calling them 3 times,  got a ride with laquinta hotel's shuttle age about an hour wait,  thank you laquinta!"
"My wife and I have been staying at this location for about 7 years and still enjoy the convenience of its proximity to our family who lives nearby.  The staff are always friendly namely Ty, Don and Kim."
The front desk service was good but it was down hill from there. The room was dated and the bed creaked. The shower had low water pressure and it never really got hot. Not what I expected from Double Tree!
"Very cool hotel in the heart of Downtown. If you are looking for expansive spaces to sprawl out in and have meetings, this is not the place, but there are amble spaces for a very personal and comfortable experience."
The artmore is a great place to stay. It is very clean and comfortable.  The staff are super friendly. We walked to the Botanical gardens from the Artmore. I have stayed here twice and would definitely stay again.
"11.3.17

Arrived in a terminal on SW Airlines which is being renovated and it is definitely improved although there are still not enough bathroom spots for the amount of traffic.

4/5 

the Doctor hit me with some LOVE Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â and a Helpful Vote!"
My room wasn't connected to the main lobby.  This was inconvienant as it wasn't the best weather during my stay.  I wan't a fan of getting rained on to go have breakfast.  The hotel is currently being refurbished as well.  Lots of contractors moving around.
"I recommend the Hyatt hotel to any one looking for excellent customer service, hospitality, cleanliness, availability, a great valet team and just feeling like your money is well spent. There isnÃ¢ÂÂt a price I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt pay to have all these aspects combined in one building!"
Price wonderful for the wonderful accomodation. Perfect for families on a road trip. Food was good. They have flavored coffee creamers too and special coffee for $1 only. I had been recommending the place to my friends.
I stayed here for a work conference and the entire staff was great! The hotel was very clean and the location was very convenient to great restaurants. The shuttle service was also a wonderful amenity to have being from out of town.
Our associates pride themselves on providing excellent guest service and will be pleased to hear they exceeded your expectations! Your review will certainly be shared with them. Thank you!
"Easily the best suite I've stayed in for the price.  The room was quiet and felt private.  The lobby was a great area to socialize at the open bar,  The staff was friendly and engaging.  They acted like we were old friends."
"Stayed for a week with my family and I have no complaints about the facility, price, friendliness of staff. Room was the perfect size for the 3 of us; we never felt cramped. And you can NEVER have too many of their cookies!!!"
"We truly value your comments and are always excited to hear that our guest found our staff to be very friendly and helpful.  We hope to have you stay with us again soon to enjoy our Boutique Hotel again.

Sincerely,"
"I have come here many times over the years, and it never disappoints! A unique urban location, yet nestled in a natural forested setting. Restaurant/bar on site is a superb amenity. Rooms are clean, parking is convenient, and staff is helpful and friendly."
"Great time in Atlanta. Great stay at Homewood Suites. Location was central to our friends in Conyers and Austell. Close to downtown attractions.  Hotel was nice, clean and staff were very helpful and friendly."
"We were there for a wedding, the reception was in one of their large rooms.  The breakfast buffet was very good as was the dinner we had the night we arrived.  Our family is large and exuberant and we were treated very well."
"Clean rooms with large bathtub, refrigerator, microwave, Friendly Staff from front desk to wait staff and valets,  Great location - close to everything downtown, Great breakfast buffet and they fix specialty omelets, pancakes and other items"
"This was our 3rd pre-flight stay and it is hard to find anything to complain about.  Everyone was super-nice, stay was comfortable (albeit very short) and the airport shuttle was prompt and quick.  Mike the shuttle driver was especially helpful!"
A very nice and clean location.  The staff is outstanding.  Free shuttle to and from the Braves games and/or Battery Park.  Parking is free with no forced valet to increase the cost of the stay. Priced much better than those at Battery Park.
This hotel is nicely located and inside a beautiful building. Rooms are a bit outdated but still offers everything that might be expected from Indigo. One remark is that the staff seems to be undermanned and often have to wait for things.
"uzoamakao2016, 

I truly appreciate your comments on your recent stay! The staff loves to hear that our valued guests are happy with their service. See you again!!!"
Michelle is the one to see at the Doubletree. She will make sure you are happy and have warm cookies. I love coming to this hotel every event.     I love the food and drinks all day.    We coming bavk in November for SURE
First night out of 10 on business trip.  Found this cute guy running across floor at 1135pm.  Not very relaxing. Hope it gets better or I can switch hotels! Good luck sleeping after having to pack and move in the middle of the night
"Hyatt Place Atlanta/Downtown Staff are world class providers of Excellent service... their professionalism and thoughtfulness is noteworthy.  They are my ""goto"" hotel when I visit Atalanta...the best bang for your buck$$$"
The staff was super friendly and helpful.  They were always willing to help and answer any questions that arose.  The concierge service was wonderful!  They recommended a grocery nearby and offered to drive us there and pick us up.  I would definitely stay there again!
This was the best place to stay it was right across the street from our convention. We had complementary happy hour 3 free drinks with refreshments also karaoke its was totally amazing. Customer service was awesome
"Nice ,clean, conveniently located in the North Atlanta area to all major roads. Nice friendly staff. It had ample parking space. Close to the Cumberland Mall with shops and food alternatives. A safe convenient place to stay!"
"Awesome hotel, very friendly staff and extremely reasonably priced. Definitely looking forward to my visit again, I don't think I will look for another place to stay. I only regret my trip wasn't longer Ã°ÂÂÂ­"
Everything was great. Nice and clean. Very helpful and friendly staff. We discovered that the Peachtree Center mall is connected to the hotel with every kind of eating place you could want. We will definitely stay here again.
This is certainly not representative of the level of service we strive to extend to our guests.   Please know your comments are taken very seriously and will be acted upon immediately.
"Rooms are clean, bed is super comfortable and staff were very attentive.  You will need a car though as shopping and restaurants are not in walking distance.  They have a nice outdoor area for lounging, if you have the time."
We're so glad you enjoyed your stay - come see us again soon!
Great location could walk to movies and Lenox Mall. Indoor pool great for winter months. But Tv in living area was broken. only 1 trash can for both rooms and bathroom. No wash cloths 2 Days in a row. Keys canceled day before departure
Very convenient and close to airport.  Service was great.  Staff was very accommodating.  Rooms have been renovated; cozy and sophisticated.  Happy hour was so much fun; breakfast was so good.  Welcome to the comfort zone!!
Great new hotel with very clean updated rooms. Breakfast cook to order staff could use some customer service training but otherwise a great weekend experience. Great location for concert events at the Cobb performing arts center.
Love this hotel! Staff made us feel so special! Bar area is fun at night w great entertainment. Great accomadations at reasonable price! Drivers are available for close destinations at no charge. Room service was great and everything we ordered was delicious!
Service is very good! Convenient location.Room is clean and orderly. Complimentary shuttle service is a big plus. The breakfast experience maybe could be better...Very satisfied with our weekend stay at this hotel.
"Wonderful stay and beautiful we wil,be staying again, hotel was book, but they got us in, just what we expected being such  loyal customers, specially since we spend an average $6,000+ in hotel with Wyndham every month"
"fantastic. plush, comfortable, will be back! Don't know what else to say other than we were treated professionally and we had a wonderful time.  Good food, great room, excellent decor, super atmosphere. Felt like a king and a queen."
"Just a few minor nits that wouldn't stop me from coming back.  My room did smell as if someone had smoked in it, so that is something I would check on right away.  Other than that, an overall great place."
My family and I recently stayed here and I was extremely disappointed. The room we had was outdated terribly.  The furniture was worn and torn and the beds were uncomfortable.  I will return to this hotel when it's updated.
"We spent two nights at Aloft, while attending Americas Mart. The staff was really nice, the rooms were perfect, they have a nice breakfast and 24 hr snacks and the property was super convenient. We are definitely planning to stay there next time!"
I came to attend anime weekend atlanta and chose thisbhotel due to the straight-shot 15 minute walk to the skybridge and had a pleasant stay without hassle of trying to book a room at the main convention hotel - and for a better price!
"Waited for 40 minutes to check-in, bathroom not completely clean, toiletries not replenished, and employees unprofessional and inattentive. Overall hotel is well decorated and comfortable. Customer centered atmosphere is lacking."
"The room was absolutely enormous and very well appointed and looked after. I'm not sure what happened to those who have written poor reviews but I can only assume that they were unlucky, as the service was exemplary while I stayed there."
"We love that Guy too, appreciate you recognizing him, we will do the same"
"Great View, especially the front rooms, lovely location and central to all the places I wanted to go. Breakfast was on time though not as varied from day to day. I didn't mind though since I only spent 4 days. Staff are friendly and attentive."
"I wouldn't say anything was above what I expected. The lobby was very nice looking, and the room was well-kept. I think it is kind of ridiculous that you have to pay for parking and internet access; the room is expensive enough."
"Great location by the Fox, and other great food and venues.  
The room was clean, big, and updated.  Front desk staff was very nice, and they had a lot of great amenities with a cafe and restaurant in the hotel.  Would definitely book there again."
1st time In Georgia after 10 years from NY. Checking in with Alicia was such a pleasure sheÃ¢ÂÂs so sweeet and knowledgeable. You have to go to the bar and have a drink made by Lea and great conversation.
"Needs some updating, fixtures need replaced.  Air conditioning in room can't be adjusted so it was too hot.  Carpets need cleaning.  Beds are good, just feather pillows, which leaves for a sore neck in the morning."
"We love our room 613, loved the view and I love high floors. Rooms are very clean and space is not a problem. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. Breakfast was really good, can't wait to come back."
"This is a clean, well-managed, and pleasant place to stay. The room was spacious and well-kept, the staff are welcoming and friendly, the breakfast staff couldn't have been nicer. I will definitely stay here again."
"The staff was very friendly, including the security guards! The hotel was very nice inside and out and the rooms were very clean. The showers were amazing and the beds were very comfortable. 10/10 would definitely recommend."
"I travel a lot and this was one of my best stays this year, i truly enjoyed my stay.
Hopefully the price want change too much once the stadium is built.
One of  Atlanta's best kept secret, so check it out"
"Great service clean room, modern up-to-date. Love the location. Great for couples and great for gay community couple or just hangout. Would recommend and would stay again. Looking forward to our next stay"
"I have been in the  hospitality business for the last 15 years, I've stayed almost at all the hotels in Atlanta, I was finally very happy with Monique's genuine caring attitude. Over the 5 start hotels I would rather stay here any day."
"We usually enjoy Embassy Suites, but would not stay in this location again. Buckhead Atlanta location is very dirty. The sheets had blood stains and the towels were dirty upon arrival. There was not enough staff to help the guests. The entire hotel was dirty."
"Excellent location.  Very close to those famous Atlanta sign seeing points.  Restaurant and stores within 10 minutes walk.  Nice view to the Olympic park for those North tower corner suite.   However, awkward interior arrangement and out of date shower sets is not preferable."
Enjoyed our stay. Great and pleasant staff. Comfortable and clean suite. The complimentary breakfast was great bc it's free. This homewood suites is in a good location in walking distance of many restaurants and the Cumberland mall.
"I loved staying at this Hotel and the Rooftop pool heated all year round was nice. I would definitely  recommend this property for leisure, business and a girls getaway! Staff was great and the rooftop restaurant and bar was nice as well!"
"This trip was perfect. It began when I tipped the bellhop for giving me my luggage, and he proceeded to bring me to my room and show me the amenities. From then on, the food was excellent, and all was terrific!"
Up on arrival was greeted by front desk very pleasant. Staff was very helpful. Room was cleaned. Had problems with ants. Reported to staff. Enjoyed made to order breakfast. Service was good. Liked the two room suite.
"We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Thx. so much for being our guest, and for your review. We hope you'll come back and stay with us again, soon!"
"Night lights are at the base of nightstands and go on automatically, helpful for safety at night. Rooms are nice size with extra seating. Would recommend. Requested early check in and was called to inform me that the room was ready. I appreciated this information."
"The staff provided outstanding service, clean and comfortable rooms! We attended a large party dinner and the food was excellent!"
"The rooms were clean, no foul odors, the bathroom was a bit dirty around the corners. The staff was very kind and the breakfast was included. The kitchenette was fully stocked, it had plates, silverware, pots and pans, and cups, perfect for long stays."
Stayed at Hyatt Place for Atlanta's Mart January show.   The location is 3 blocks from the mart and was the PERFECT place to stay.  Had a fabulous dinner at Max Lager's next door and the craft beers were great!
The hotel was bright and clean. Our view in hotel room and breakfast area had lots of trees which was peaceful. Everything was in working order and staff was attentive and friendly. I would stay here again.
Embassy suites was a very nice place to stay! I did everything online so when I got there everything was ready and I didn't have to wait! The location is great as well! I would definitely stay there again!
"Average/good hotel for the price. Great view in room. Clean. Excellent customer service in the gift shop. In room lamp wasnÃ¢ÂÂt working and the chargers didnÃ¢ÂÂt work but it was addressed adequately. Bought the hotel robe, love it."
Everything is first rate except the wifi and parking for check-in.  Wifi kept clicking off and parking at check in was a race against the clock with unhelpful parking employees.  Besides those annoyances all was very good.
"Breakfast was great, check in was fast, employees were smiling and happy to be of service to you. Valet parking was quick and the restaurant Ruth Chris was Amazing!!  Overall the hotel delivered exceptional service."
"Good access to shopping mall and walkway to Galleria and Cobb Centre. Atlanta is not a city that is easy to navigate on foot, but this great location really helped. Rooms nicely decorated, clean and large."
Shane took awesome care of us as we visited the Artmore for the first time. He made the check in process painless and enjoyable! The room is beautiful and the hotel indescribable. Authentic beauty in the middle of the city. Thank you Shane!
This was the worst hotel I ever stayed at. You have to request and pay for a refrigerator. The staff is not that friendly. I never had such horrible experience at a hotel. They charged me twice and had to fight to get refund.
"So, we just checked in and have never been placed in the north tower. We can hear our neighbor coughing, the room reeks of cigarette smoke and there are skittles underneath our bed. So glad we opted to stay here."
The rooms were very clean and spacious. Loved the view.. The hotel staff were super nice. Room service was superb... Located to near everything. Lots of restaurants within walking distance... Will definitely be staying here again
"A great experience at Westin Peachtree Plaza, Atlanta! The rooms were clean, the view was spectacular, the service impeccable. A modern and amenity filled locale with plenty to do downtown. Worth the stay - plan to be pampered."
"Visited for New Years Eve/Bridal Party

Earl and Wayne at the front desk made my stay wonderful!
Bartenders Sheldon and Rodney made the best drinks!
Bed comfy and beautiful room decor! 
Just in love with this hotel!"
Michelle was a very great receptionist. She is very well able to direct customers to the area. I really canÃ¢ÂÂt wait to come back and stay again. I will be recommending this hotel to others in the future. Thanks for having such good customer service!!!
"I stayed for 2 nights during a conference. The hotel had many guest and staff likely had many responsibilities above normal. However, they were genuinely pleased to serve and did so with smiles on their faces. Very friendly people."
"This hotel is in a great locations, close to shopping, food, clubs, bars etc...... The service from the front desk , room service, food and bar 5***** this is the only hotel I stay in when visiting Atlanta."
"Mandarin Oriental hotels are usually really great. I had the shrimp and grits for breakfast and they were incredible. I usually don't love southern cooking, but the food at this hotel was great. rooms were comfortable and people were friendly."
I had breakfast at the Renaissance restaurant and Belene took care of my table. She was very cordial and clearly genuinely committed to make me confortable. She even showed interest to know how where I come from.
Shuttle service was a joke - van service terrible - 26$ steak was extremely tough but breakfast was good.  Service great but rooms getting toward outdated.  And they make you post 200 words when less would do.  huh!
We love hearing great comments such as yours! Thank you Efficient.
Stayed two nights during a stormy period of time.  Guest services were very friendly.  Limited restaurant staff available to work due to very poor weather conditions.  Done a very good job considering the circumstances.
"Beautiful location, quiet rooms, comfy bed, GIANT shower, friendly staff who are exceptionally courteous and go out of their way at every opportunity to be helpful...what more could you want?!? Definitely recommend!!!"
"Really friendly staff and a great bar and restaurant. Rooms are clean and okay, but not very special and water pressure in my shower was too low. During the snow fall they were very helpfull with finding a taxi."
An interesting hotel in Atlanta.  Nice little courtyard area near the reception.  We had quite a walk to the room and it was on two levels which IÃ¢ÂÂve never seen before.  The room was clean and comfortable however and we did enjoy our short stay.
"The rooms were in terrible shape. Dirty and dusty, furniture was in bad shape. The bathroom had missing grout and rusty hardware. Not a location I was comfortable staying at and had to go to another property."
Spent a couple days in one of their luxurious suites and it was wonderful.  The assistant manager was very accommodating and professional.  Have stayed there on several and have never been disappointed.
The rooms are so spacious! Beds are so comfy! The hotel has so many great places to eat close by and the best view of centennial park! The rooms are so quiet! I didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to leave and come back to reality!
"Great location if you are wanting to stay within walking distance of the aquarium, olympic park and cocacola factory. (which I highly reccomend as the parking will already be taken care of and the hotel itself is very accomidating!)"
Very good accommodations.  Room was clean and staff was very nice.  Rooms and hallways were quiet even though they were very busy.   Breakfast was included and was very good.  I would stay here again in the future.
Perfect location when going to the Georgia aquarium and the world of Coke. Breakfast was really great! Could use a few updates. Always our first choice when staying in downtown Atlanta Georgia. Great for families.
Crystal Stokely provided me with stellar service upon my arrival.  Absolutely white glove service.  I have come for a very important meeting.  The transition from entry of the hotel to directions to the elevator. Seamless!
It all starts at the welcome....when we got to the Westin buckhead must truly say that Mike T. At the front desk customer service was AMAZING.. he made sure we was good from beginning to the end.  Thank u
The Loews is absolutely beautiful and their associate Margaret saved the day after my reservation was unable to be found. She was patient and willing to help as the hotel was almost fully booked - great customer service!!
Awesome place. Parking was easy no valet! Loved the window in the bathroom.  The room was a great size.  Super friendly staff.  We walked to Coca Cola and Aquarium. Great location!  I would stay here again.
Staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  The entire facility was very nice.  Adjacent to the Aquarium with a great view of Atlanta.  Parking was directly adjacent to the hotel and reasonably priced.
Great location. Extremely close to shops and restaurants. Family had a great time! We enjoyed being able to walk to SunTrust Park and the baseball theme. The staff was friendly and made the kids feel welcome. The staff brought fresh cookies for the kids.
My academic conference and stay at the hotel were enjoyable.  Achsa had great customer service  and the front desk team and breakfast team went above and beyond in service.  I will return to this hotel on my next trip to ATL.
Fantastic hotel within walking distance of Atlanta aquarium and Coca-Cola world. Had a king suite which we could not fault. Staff amazingly friendly and helpful. Having a swimming pool was an extra bonus
"Our stay at The Ellis was great! ALL services are top notch. They were right there with whatever we needed, whenever we needed anything. Would definitely recommend and we will for sure stay here again."
I stayed one night at this Crown Plaza and was impressed with the size of my room and it's cleanliness. The bathroom had a stand alone shower which had great pressure. The staff were warm and friendly. Breakfast was good again with great service.
"The place is beautiful,one of my girlfriend's sister had her bridal shower there. We had drinks at the bar with h'orderves. later we went up to one of the suites and had the bridal shower. The staff was really good, a very relaxed atmosphere"
"Nice hotel.  Clean, modern, great service.  Great price considering I booked very late.  Would definitely recommend.  I'm not sure what else to add - I was only in the room for a about 8 hours, including sleep.  It was nice."
Delighted with my guest experience and can't wait to return.  Hotel staff delivered consistently outstanding customer service and made my stay very enjoyable.  The fitness center and women's locker room amenities were first-class.
"Thx. so much for your review, and for being our guest. We're so glad you and your wife enjoyed your stay with us during your event. We hope you will come back again soon!"
Very friendly service at Ritz Buckhead. They always remember us at front desk and concierge. Bellmen always friendly.  They remember us from previous stays and are very accommodating. Rooms are great and spa is wonderful.
"Nice big Rooms,with sitting area and full kitchen,well maintained but not aimed at tourists : if you want to sleep a little longer be aware that breakfast is served only till 9.30.. sunday check in service could have been better as well."
"Really enjoyed the hotel. First night went big at the whisky bar. Sat outside rooftop. Couch very comfortable. Had the tacos, amazing, pizza, very delicious and the drinks done to perfection. The staff was very attentive."
Very nice hotel in great location. Many nearby restaurants. The surrounding area is very park like. Close to St JosephÃ¢ÂÂs medical center. The front desk was extraordinary. Very friendly and welcoming. Definitely a go to hotel.
beautiful hotel-great staff and very close to the galleria and cumberland mall. shuttle service was great and driver stan was very nice.  king sixe beds were so comfortable and the rooms were so spacious.  service was very friendly and helpful.
"We're so glad you enjoyed our pool and zen garden, and that you had a chance to have a quiet moment during your conference. Please come back and stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead!"
"Thx. so much for your review. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay during your convention, and the food! We've very proud of our culinary team. Please come back and stay with us again!"
"A very comfortable, clean and quiet stay. Staff were friendly and helpful. There was a secure area to park your car overnight, and the hotel also offered a shuttle service. If I were to visit Atlanta again, I would stay at the Hyatt Place again."
"I had a birthday celebration for my son. This was the perfect location. He and his friends went to the mall, movies and they went swimming. We had a fabulous time. I  love the Embassy. We always use for family events"
"We came here for a family wedding. Very impressed with the size of the hotel, the friendly staff & the size of our room. One small issue, we ordered a cot for our 13 month old with lady at reception but it never arrived."
"Good family hotel! We enjoyed the pool and staff was friendly. Breakfast was really good but not included, we had to add to our room value daily, bug it was totally worth it! I would stay there again for sure!"
you cannot go wrong here. The only downfall is you cannot park yourself and forced to pay 30 for parking. The rooms are awesome but the ironing boards and irons need an upgrade. taking a taxi anywhere is not that expensive either. great location
Had a late international arrival at ATL and an early departure the next day. Check-in was quick and courteous and the room was clean and comfortable. Shuttle was prompt so I was very pleased with everything about this property.
"The hotel was nice, clean, and comfortable. The front desk staff was polite, courteous, and efficient. I had dinner in the hotel restaurant. The pork sandwich was great! The price was reasonable (considering it's a hotel restaurant). The overall experience was enjoyable."
Rooms are starting to show their age.  Was a nice property other than aging furniture.  Very clean and comfortable.  Staff was friendly and welcomed me as a Marriott platinum member.  I would stay here again if I were to be in the area.
We're so very sorry to hear that your room and stay were not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies.
"I was in town for a few nights. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly. There were several good places to eat, within walking distance. All-in-All, it was 'Just Right'"
from 7 year old grandson..perfect stay..nothing went wrong! celebrating his birthday and Braves WIN! staff went above expectations to make sure all the best! will definitely repeat every chance we get!
"Excellent hotel, friendly and helpful staff, fantastic location, and great restaurant on the first floor. I don't know Atlanta well, and really appreciated the help, advice and suggestions I got from the staff. Akbar at the front desk was especially kind and helpful."
"We were in ATl celebrating my Husband's birthday, this hotel was wonderful, we had a premium room and enjoyed the snacks. Room had a nice fragrance when we walked in, loved it. Hotel staff was gracious and friendly."
Do yourself a favor and just sleep on the floor. Or the bathtub. Or save the money for the room and just sleep in your car. Your sleep will be better than on the mattress in the room. And a lot cheaper.
No problems.  No Complaints.  Clean Quiet Comfortable room.  Helpful Staff.  There is really no reason to stay anywhere else.  I love the breakfast buffet!  Lots of variety of good healthy choices.  The coffee is excellent as well!
You are so welcome! We are so glad you enjoyed your stay at the Homewood Suites-Atlanta Cumberland! I will share your comments with the Homewood Suites-Atlanta Cumberland team.
"This hotel is only worth 2.5-3 stars generally. The room bed is not clean as we expected, however, the price is as much higher as 5-star hotels. I would recommend other 3-star hotels like Marriott or Hyatt."
"This was a great trip, the hotel is clean the staff is courteous, professional, polite, and accommodating. 
Amber, Stephanie, Yasmina, and Tommie, and Janina were excellent, and a great testament to the hotel."
Great place!  Front desk young lady was very accommodating.  I didn't get her name but she deserves a big pat on the back!  We didn't stop till 9pm.  Very clean rooms. Many choices at breakfast. Price is right. Defiantly recommend and will stop again.
It was simply beautiful! The staff was friendly and very helpful. The rooms were perfect. Everything was clean and update. Great location with a nice view. Located near Buckhead Atlanta. I have no complaints.
"The hotel is showing wear and tear. We just visited a year ago and the conditions have decreased dramatically. This was our third visit. The first was fantastic, the second was ok but this was was not the best."
A great upscale hotel with moderate prices  that is 1 exit away from the Atlanta airport.  Really enjoyed my stay there thereÃ¢ÂÂs a cross section of restaurants and pubs right near the hotel as well which adds to the convenience of the hotel
Overall the service was excellent.  The cloth chair should be removed. They are light in color and are stained. The bathroom needed some attention the tub stopper was broken and needed repaired. Using a rubber stopper isn't a gook look.
"Always courteous and friendly staff make the stay enjoyable and welcoming.  Nice location within walking distance of GT, restaurants, MARTA, and a park for exercise.  I have stayed at this location previously and will continue to do so in the future."
The hotel was not as luxurious as I expected based on their online presence. Specifically the women's floor was advertised with additional pampering and I didn't feel it lived up to the expectation I had.
"Very nice hotel  close to Atlanta airport. Bar and restaurant area very modern and clean. Service at the bar restaurant was terrible, waitresses chatting together and on phones .
Waited 20 minutes for a drink, incorrect food delivered , I did not tip."
The room was very nice in every aspect. I particularly liked the window that separates the room from the garden. It is refreshing to start the morning with some sunlight  from outside. Very good working environment.
"great location. OK rooms. no breakfast but you can self-buy good items for your breakfast. the bar serves medium-quality food and has the slowest service ever. it was during the Atlanta Mart and maybe it is an excuse, but not a good one."
Beautiful hotel!! Location is convenient. The reason I didnÃ¢ÂÂt rate as a 5 is because of a few issues. The bathroom sink drained very slow. The shower took 5 minutes to warm up. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean.
We stayed 2 nights in the St Regis and enjoyed every moment of our stay. Staff were all very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived. Rooms are clean and tastefully decorated. Definitely recommend!
Very nice hotel rooms were nice size beds comfortable hotel was clean. Elevators slow one day of three. Bar prices were expensive but usual for hotel service. Conference rooms were comfortable staff friendly
This is a comfortable hotel close to the airport was very quiet rooms. Large comfortable bed. Large walk-in shower. Sitting area in room. Less than half a mile to the airport. I was disappointed that there was no bathtub.
We're pleased you enjoyed yourself while in Atlanta Midtown. There's so many wonderful things to see and do. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
"It is a brand new hotel
So all rooms are nice, up to date and comfortable. 
Hotel offers very limited services: very small lounge with very limited offer and no swimming pool. There is not a real restaurant. 
Ideally located for transiting by plane"
Cleanest hotel we stayed at on a week long vacation.  Nice quality rooms and parking was easy (although daily charge applied).  The hotel is conveniently located to the good restaurants at Perimeter Mall as well.
"We were shocked with how nice and friendly this hotel and staff were. Staying by the airport you never know what you are going to get. We HIGHLY recommend staying here! Clean rooms, comfy beds, and awesome staff."
Hearing you experienced such outstanding service from our family of staff is very exciting. I look forward to personally passing along your compliments to those you mentioned. We hope to welcome you back to the Atlanta Marriott Buckhead Hotel & Conference Center soon.
"I wouldn't go here for a leisure trip, but it was close to my workshop.  Very nice facilities! The room and facilities were very nice. I would stay here again if I needed to be in the area close to the airport."
Your compliments are very much appreciated. Our team works hard to make sure guests like you are comfortable and have a memorable experience. We enjoy showing off our great property and are looking forward to your return.
The only problem was the breakfast buffet staff.  The lady was rude and hovered over the food.  She would address the children about dropping food and not the parents.  I would still stay at this hotel when I am in GA
"Fun hotel, great design. Lots of extra touches, keyless entry via smartphone, ample staff, snacks in lobby at times, water in lobby. Midtown has replaced Buckhead for my preference and this location is excellent. Fair warning - $34 valet parking adds up fast."
"Though I probably wouldn't stay downtown for leisure, this was a very convenient, friendly option for work travel. It was clean and we'll-staffed and the beds were comfy. Great shower and the blackout shades were amazing."
Very disappointed in the treatment received for leaving personal items in room and having a problem getting them back.  I immediately notified the staff after check out. I will get to the bottom of this.
Our room was comfortable and clean.  The hotel had a nice lobby area with comfy chairs. The cookies were delicious too.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet although it was a little pricey.  I would definitely stay here again.
Hotel was convenient to Sun Trust baseball park for Atlanta Braves baseball games. The room was nice and clean. Good filling breakfast with waffles and eggs. Would definitely stay there again for another weekend trip.
"Looking for cost-effective stay in this area and the reviews were correct.  The hotel is well run.  The rooms are modern, clean and up-to-date.  Breakfast was good. Location was terrific. The queen double is a comfortable large room."
"The hotel staff was probably the most genuinely friendly and serving staff I've ever met.  No matter the time of day or night every person I met asked what they could do for me, with a friendly smile, and immediately hopped on the task."
Michelle was awesome at checkin and helped everyone. When we had issues she came in and made it right. We love the restraunt and the bar tinder is great. The pool was closed but we will try again tomorrow
"Great staff, especially supervisor David Gaskins who helped us out in booking the last available room after a ground stop shut down the Airport at 3 am. We were saved from having to spend the night sleeping at the terminal. Thank you!!!"
Need to improve maintenance service and some areas of customer service. The location of this hotel was excellent for our purpose. I would recommend for future visits if the management improves on service.
"The hotel was fine, a little bit remote, but the omelettes at breakfast from Ms. Mary Doyle were really outstanding! In general the crew at the hotel was really nice, and the service of Andrew at breakfast was great! Will be back!"
Beware of the Manager who had no workability with mistakes made and problem solving. I saw a few roaches. My room was facing a roof. Housekeeping was poor as they were no responsive when requested. There were 2 staff members that were nice.
"This hotel is beautiful and classy.  The staff are extremely helpful and courteous.  It is adjacent to the Lenox Square Mall.  The only complaints I have are the water pressure is lacking, and the self parking rate is exorbitant ($27 per night)."
"Midtown Atlanta is up and coming.  Will be a great location in a year.  Hotel is clean, has nice rooms and friendly staff. Good parking situation with serviced underground garage. I would definitely stay here again."
No complaints. Excellent location right next to MARTA. The staff members we encountered were friendly. Rooms very nice & modern with large walk in shower. Bathroom products very nice. Bed was huge and very comfortable.
"The hallways leading up to the room smelled like urine. The room itself smelled like mildew and urine, the carpet was wet, the commode had rust stains and the furniture looked like it was soiled. I could not stay."
"Convenient to World of Coca-Cola, Georgia Aquarium and lots of restaurants.  Also very close to Coca-Cola headquarters. Used both taxi and uber to get around town and the service was very good. Hotel was clean and staff was excellent."
"We were visiting Atlanta for our Hairston Family Reunion.   We have family living there,  so we decided to return again because we really enjoyed the last time .  The service was unbelievable,  upon arrival we were greeted by the best ."
"Very clean hotel, the staff was very friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend the Hyatt to anyone traveling to the Atlanta area. The in-room dining offered a variety of delicious options, we didn't have to wait long for our meal either."
"This hotel was excellent in all services.  The staff was outstanding, friendly and helpful.  Rooms were clean and spacious. The afternoon reception on Thursday night was a plus and breakfast was great. Very convenient location to shopping, attractions and restaurants ."
"Wonderful time my Bff and I had, staff was friendly, helpful and very nice. Loved the breakfast, and free dinner was a plus. I would come back and stay at this facility again and I will recommend this place to family and friends.."
"The lobby and the room had a modern vibe.  The beds were very comfortable.  Both ladies who handled our check-in and check-out were friendly.  The room was clean, pretty spacious, and the shower had excellent water pressure and heat."
"We were happy to have you as our guests, thanks for staying"
The staff in this lovely hotel could not be more attentive.  Great restaurant in the hotel and many within walking distance.  It was refreshing & convenient to have kitchen and washer/dryer in my suite.  My new go-to hotel in Atlanta.
"I've been to a lot of hotels, but the folks at this property were just super nice and helpful.  I've not met anyone more concerned about making my trip enjoyable. The room was great, the workout room was adequate, and the view amazing."
"We were pleased with the location and the cleanliness of the hotel.  Nicklaus at the front desk was knowledgeable of the area and was able to recommend nearby  restaurants.  

They would have received 5 stars but housekeeping began banging on doors at 9am."
"The hotel was nice with comfortable, clean rooms. The shuttle service to surrounding downtown locations was very helpful since we didn't have a car. Thanks to all for helping this to be a good birthday stay for my wife."
"The venue perfect for ball games. Battery and access from hotel great. All staff was pleasant Valet a bit pricey but once you park, NO reason to move your vehicle. It also ended with a great win by the Red Sox. GO SOX!!!!!"
This was the worst Embassy Suites I have ever stayed in.   The rooms were filthy and the furniture looked like it had not been replaced in years.  There were food particles embedded in the fabric of the chairs.
Enjoyed my stay prior to my flight out of Atlanta.  Nice clean room beautiful lobby area.  The evening reception was just the right start to the evening.  We even had time for breakfast prior to leaving.
I was apart of the 47th Maconite Scholarship Gala. From Friday September 2 thru Sunday Septembr 4. Excellent place to hold an event. I enjoyed my stay. The staff was very good helping with questions. Of the cookies was great.
I have been coming to this hotel with my wife for years.   We have traveled around the world and this is one of the best hotel experiences.  Extremely upscale.   Decadent.   Lavish.  Top notch spa services.   Fine dining.   My go to choice of hotels.
Good hotel in buck head. Wifi needs. Hotel provided jetpack but still not as fast as other hotels. Overall good experience. Did not have a chance to try restaurant but many restaurants within short walking distance of hotel. Good maid service.
"Very nice hotel, great location, and very nice staff. Fitness room is tight but updated equipment.  Nice size pool for a quick bit of relaxation. Hotel will take you via van or golf cart to many of the local eateries."
"this hotel is in dire need of renovation; the rooms are clean but everything is old and falling apart; moldy bathroom walls; on one afternoon they cut water with no warning to guests, could not use toilet or wash hands - unacceptable"
"The hotel is very close to the aquarium, rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff is helpful and friendly. The complimentary breakfast was very good. The laundry room was very clean and not expensive. The only bad service I experienced was in the hotel restaurant."
My friends and I had a wonderful time / stay at this hotel. Jameika and staff were very friendly. The rooms were nice and clean. I can't wait to return and I hope to see the same friendly staff members when I return.
Wow - the friendliest staff ever encountered!  So nice to hear that from our visitors.  Hope you will plan to return to enjoy a good workout and few laps.
"A good, central location in Midtown situated near restaurants and bars, but also to Piedmont Park where there's plenty to do. Jogging, botanical garden, museums and all sorts of other activities. I enjoyed the fitness center and the good breakfast menu."
Hotel was very much perfect for business !!.. right by the airport and offered a very good menu for dinner. I will stay again .. staff ant front desk was very helpful and always wanted to ensure that my stay was good
I stayed at this hotel a few years ago (wasn't impressed) and was enthused when I entered it this time - it's refreshed!!!  Lobby and rooms are done very well - clean and in great order.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
All the staff were very friendly and helpful. It's close to the convention center about a 15 minute walk and there were many restaurants close by. The subway from the airport took us right next to our hotel for about $3.
"Everything was great. Friendly, sincere staff, room in excellent condition, very comfortable lounge area. The Japanese garden really helped set the tone of our stay. Especially loved the extensive fitness room and it having windows."
"The hotel and staff were exceptional and our family enjoyed our stay.  Traveling with tweens is at times challenging but they were entertained and loved the club lounge amenities, the pool, and the room."
"Wasn't really thrilled like other Marriott locations. Staff was nice. The room looked worn and not well maintained. This was my first time at the location, my overall thoughts were just okay location. Nothing spectacular."
"Very nice room and facility, hot breakfast (included) was also very good.  Pool was perfect, temp exactly right.  Most of staff were terrific, but weekend morning clerk and manager were rude and unhelpful."
"Always friendly staff who somehow remember my name even after long periods of time.  Great service, consistently nice rooms usually clean, slow elevators, nice fitness facility, excellent location in North Atlanta.  Breakfast bar is consistently good with great service.  Overall, no complaints."
Wonderful stay and great hotel.  Everyone that we interacted with at the hotel was very pleasant.  We only stayed one night but it was a great experience.  The hotel is in a great location in the Georgia Tech area.
They were using an old blankets on my bed for a mattress cover at the end of the day having to call room service twice for the same issue. Delayed my resting time even on the afternoon I checked in with this issue.
"Typical Atlanta, nice rooms, hideous building, and poor service. The staff was uninformed, rude, and generally disinterested in the guest experience. The rooms were indeed nice and had all you needed. Your fellow tenants will surely be stuck up and loud. Welcome to Atlanta."
"Great hotel in a location away from the busy city. Pool was nice, breakfast was better than most, and the room was clean and spacious. Will definitely stay again. The room fits a family of six with ease."
"The staff at this hotel were amazing, so friendly at all times. The room was large with all amenities. It is within walking distance to Atlanta Botanical Gardens. The hotel has a mixer in the evening with light snacks and beverages. Breakfast was good."
"I'll stay hear for future in town get always. From the call making the reservation to the housekeeping, every employee was kind and courteous. Rooms were clean.Bed slept comfortable. Complimentary breakfast was great."
"The hotel was absolutely beautiful, very clean, and inviting. A great place to hold a meeting and very hospitable service. ItÃ¢ÂÂs also a great place for a group of colleagues and friends to have a conference."
"We are truly glad you enjoyed your stay with us Sonya, the pleasure was ours. Come back and visit us again soon."
"Had a lovely night staying here after a very busy two weeks travelling around the south. Customer service was spot on, in particular check in staff. Would definitely stay here again when I return to ATL"
The entire staff of the hotel was very accommodating to myself and my travel party. From the parking attendants to the friendly faces at the front desk. Every encounter was pleasant and respectful. Everyone was treated like a VIP.
"I stayed here on a business trip and the accommodations were great.  The rooms and the hotel has a high end decor and is very well maintained.  The staff was very friendly and professional, I had a pleasant stay and felt welcomed."
"Pros: 
Nice rooms
Nice staff
Cons:
Beds a little uncomfy

We enjoyed our stay in one of our favorite cities.
Huge property and nice staff. The breakfast was okay as well. 
Check in could have been faster, but all in all good."
"Wonderful hotel.  Great location, safe area, free shuttle for nearby travel, beautiful and quiet accommodations.  Friendly staff.  Delicious restaurant.  Easy check in and out.  Very close by shopping and food!  Even bike rentals!"
"Great location, very friendly staff, clean/comfortable rooms, hot breakfast, excellent restaurants and shopping close by. This hotel is an excellent value. Free onsite parking and shuttle very nice amenities."
"Room was very nice, but the floor around the AC unit was wet.  Nice bathroom. The dinner and breakfast were great!!..well worth the money!  I felt safe here as well.  This was a great getaway for a concert"
"We chose this hotel because they accepted pets. Nice, spacious rooms plus very pretty grounds. We enjoyed the breakfast as well. We've actually stayed here several times, and it has been a good choice."
"I stay at the hotel it is across the Olympic park callable to downtown businesses and MARTA. Legal Sea food restaurant is in the building, aquarium is next to it. Breakfast is better than standard do it yourself."
Room seemed outdated.  Bathroom was a little sketchy.  The sports bar was nice but crazy prices.  Decent for a quick one night stay for an early flight.  I probably wouldn't book here if I wasn't an Honors member.
"Premium priced yet missing a lot of the modern amenities that should come with the premium price tag. No grand lobby, no coffee or tea machine in the room, room was dusty but staff was friendly and helpful in relocating us to a clean room."
Signage poor. Lighting is yellow and outdated. More natural light needed. I didn't feel safe as the door had a huge gap underneath and someone could have worked through. The chaise was filthy with stains. Bathroom.door blocked tub/shower.
Wonderful hotel with great service and staff. Clean modern room with flat screen tv from Samsung and plenty of storage. Nice lounge and lobby with beautiful staircase and bar. Jp restaurant is great place to eat with high rating for food and service.
What an incredibly beautiful and elegant hotel; the staff could not have been better and we were treated so special!!  The spa is so nice and the extra amenities of the hotel really make it a wonderful choice.
"We are always excited to hear that our guest have nothing but good comments to share.  We truly appreciate that you enjoyed the hotel and our staff.  We look forward to having you be our guest again in the near future.

Thank you,"
Great location & Staff as usual. We were staying here for Music Midtown and is was convenient and easy Parking. We will definitely stay here again for our Midtown ATL travel. Bar & Food is excellent as well.
Your compliments are very much appreciated. Our team works hard to make sure guests like you are comfortable and have a memorable experience. We enjoy showing off our great property and are looking forward to your return.
I love this place.  It is secluded and quiet.  The staff are great.  My only complaint is that the rooms always smell musty.  I think the A/C units need an overhaul.  Still it is one of my favorite places to stay in the area.
The staff were nice but the rooms were outdated and musty smelling. There is easy access to the Lenox mall next door. I had one meal in restaurant which was fine but expensive. There is a Starbucks in the lobby.
"The Embassy Suites staff were very courteous, the room design was pleasing and spacious, the room and hotel was very clean, and the bed comfortable.  I would recommend this hotel to future business travelers."
"One of the best hotel's we have stayed at.
From the staff, room size, breakfast and happy hour all was top shelf.
Perfect location close to restaurants, Georgia World Congress Center, Philips Arena, The Aquarium, World of Coca Cola, Centennial Park and much more."
"Stayed here 1 night while in Atlanta, hotel was clean, beds were comfortable and staff was great, the hotel has a bar, lounge area and a restaurant. Great stay if you looking for a reasonable hotel  that's clean and convenient."
loved this hotel!! we are diamond hyatt gold passport so were upgraded to a spectacular suite! free self parking- 10  minute drive to buckhead. we loved it! our package included a 60 minute massage and free breakfast at villa Christina.
A very pleasant low stress trip. The staff was very polite and helpful. Hotel was quiet and clean. Definitely on the short list of places to stay when visiting the galleria area. Recommended for business or leisure stay.
"The service received by the staff was second to none for our business meeting.  Also, the attendees all raved about the presentation and quality of the food.  We'll definitely book our next business meeting at this hotel."
"For the price, the accommodations were good. Location is great,close to eateries and actives. Will definitely stay here again when in the ATL area. Didnt get to eat the breakfast but it looked really good."
When I go back to Atlanta Glenn hotel will be the hotel I will go back to! Very very close to Mercedes Benz stadium!!! That roof top bar is exquisite!! Free wine from 530 to 630!! The staff is extremely nice Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â
"Our two nights' stay was very good. The hotel gave valet parking discount. The hotel is in a nice area and we walked to nearby Peachtree St where several bars and restaurants were available.
Would definitely stay here again."
Really lovely hotel close to attractions. Staff very attentive. Only wish I could of purchased the clock in the room loved it but they wouldn't sell it to me great place in reception to buy snacks and food
"The hotel is wonderful and the staff is very professional. I used this location for a family gathering over the holidays and it was a great decision... I would recommend it to anyone traveling to the Atlanta, GA area. I will definitely stay again."
"Big rooms for those traveling with children or 2 couples.  Separate bedroom and bathrooms for some privacy, and large living room/kitchen for gathering.   Nice TVs in all rooms.  Got up too late for Breakfast, so can't comment on that.  Very convenient to  GA 400."
"The Room was wonderful, The staff Amazing, The Bed was the only thing I would have changed.  I was up several Times at night trying to get comfortable.  I ended up sleeping on the couch as the bed was hard and lumpy."
"We stayed here for the Peachtree Road race on July 3rd. The staff at the Westin couldn't have been more friendlier and accommodating to last minute request. The room was great, with an awesome view. We will be staying here again every year."
"All staff very helpfull, especially Mike, the shuttle driver made our trip extra enjoyable with his amazing informative and friendly attention. This hotel is a practical airport option. Breakfast and dinner included."
"Just terrible, had to switch rooms twice and still had issues. Shower broke, first room had a flood, fuse blew using hairdryer,  best part were the warm cookies they handed out.  This place was a total nightmare."
"Well situated, friendly and efficient staff, well appointed and spacious bedroom. Excellent concierge and arrival and departure arrangements, including shuttle bus from airport Well laid out and spacious general areas, with adequate catering options. The only negative is the quality of the Executive lounge facilities."
My family and I stayed at this hotel for Thanksgiving.  Everything was wonderful including the staff!! The happy hour was good. The only complaint would be that more space is needed for breakfast. The rooms appeared to be well kept.
I always feel comfortable staying at this hotel.  The staff is extremely friendly and courteous and the rooms are normally at the perfect temperature. The breakfast staff was wonderful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all.
"Nice hotel, great food (albeit slow), small but nicely furnished room, friendly service, but parking is a nightmare -- not enough room out front for Valet.  I drove around the block 5 times before being able to park and drop off my car."
We reserved several rooms for a Wedding and everything worked perfectly.  We also had a rehearsal get together in the bar and it was decorated nicely and we had our own section.  Staff was polite and professional and everything went exactly according to plan!
First itÃ¢ÂÂs 45 for Valet and they suck with promptness and service. The room service food was terrible also. So my advice is donÃ¢ÂÂt book here. Also was no outlets by the bed to charge my cell phone. Stupid I must.
For the cost of the room you would thought it had a fridge  and a microwave.  The sink was stop up. I order breakfast on my  reservation they said I didn't I wanted to add it they said it was too late ..
This hotel served our needs. It was clean. Being in Midtown allows for numerous dining choices within walking distance of the hotel. The attentiveness of the staff was excellent. I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay near Midtown Atlanta.
"Front Desk staff very efficient and helpful able to answer all questions. $12.00 parking fee seemed excessive but perhaps normal for the area, otherwise a pleasant stay. Being close to Rte 85 allowed quick acess for drive to the city"
We were travelling with a tour group but were required to leave a $100 deposit on a credit card upon check in. This should not have been required. We had a room overlooking the air conditioning and building - no view. Bathroom was very small.
"Location was great, but they charge for  everything even water, we had 3 rooms one didnÃ¢ÂÂt even have towels took about 39 minutes to get them. Parking was awful. Some of the staff was not friendly. WouldnÃ¢ÂÂt want to stay here again."
Had a great short stay at the Ellis.  Friendly greeting with a smile and very accommodating!  Looking forward to staying again on my next business or family retreat to the downtown Atlanta area.  Thank you!
"I took a weekend trip to Atlanta with my mother and stayed here. She was very impressed with it. We loved the location, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is not super fancy, but it met all of our needs."
Bed and pillows was comfy. Nice TV and bathroom shower. Only complaint would be the paper thin walls. I couldn't fall asleep anyway and hearing every little thing didn't help. Including the person next to me using the toilet and then flushing.
Very friendly staff. Check in process was easy. Lots of things to do around the area. Breakfast hour and food were good. Not to comfortable about having to walk to the parking garage at night. Didn't see security that often.
Spent 3 very pleaseant nights at the hotel in ealy Nov. Excellent staff in a compact hotel with all facilities nicely available. Bar very welcoming.Weekend package rate very attractive. Location first class for shopping or restaurants & downton only 15mins away.
"We really enjoyed the stay everything was great, only cons traffic getting in and out was busy due to construction and we hated the smell of the soap, shampoo/conditioners. I also will never understand when you pay more for a hotel it doesn't include breakfast."
"hank you for your review and post, we're delighted to hear you had such a great experience and look forward to hosting you on your next trip to Atlanta!"
Close to airport is the best I can say about this hotel. More than the lobby needs updating & cleaning. Last & most importantly the staff needs costumer service retraining. It didn't live up to most of my previous Doubletree encounters.
Took family there and the place was decent for the value we pay. It was clean and the staff were friendly. Very quiet and homey feels. We enjoyed our stay there and would stay there again if we had to.
Bad-stay away!!! Not worth the bother -very loud lazy staff-not clean and not safe..I would not recommend to my worst enemy! I think they hire employees off the street! Typical airport Hotel in bad location.
"The Westin is a nice hotel, downtown Atlanta. Large well equipped fitness center. Pool was closed during my stay. Ate breakfast at The CafÃÂ©, a bit pricey, $23 for small buffet. Room was clean and wel lequipped."
Attended annual conference (10th year). The Grand Hyatt is very consistent and well located.  The staff are friendly.  The service is good and access to quality restaurants is convenient.  Enjoyed my stay.
Trendy hip spot in a great location. So convenient to walk around everywhere. They had a pleasant front desk staff. The bar attendant could've been more friendlier and helpful. Rooms were comfy & they had some great pillows to sleep on.
"The staff was very friendly and the room was nice and clean. Stayed for 3 nights and would stay again and would recommend. Overall, the stay was pleasant and there is nothing that we did not like about it"
Spent a weekend here. We were in walking distance to many places. We did not use the car the whole weekend. Great room and a very nice breakfast. Located near several churches. Very close to restaurants and shopping.
"Stayed there while in town for a family wedding. Our room was great, the hotel staff extremely helpful, and the common areas quite pleasant and comfy. The attached restaurant/bar was fine, and has an outdoor dining option."
"I liked the hotel, my toilet made too much noise, 413 Dominic Henry Also Bobbie was very helpful and accomendating! Give her a raise! Put a pull up bar in the gym. I love your hotel that breakfast was banging!!!  

Dominic Henry"
My family loves the indoor pool at this hotel. The rooms are spacious and the breakfast is good. It is a convenient stay while in Atlanta.  We have stayed here several times and have always enjoyed it.
"Great food, valet is very quick, pool amazing, great service, nice people, punctual service, super clean. I must go back. I stayed on the Caroline Astor Suite with great views. Make sure to order room service breakfast on your terrace."
"This was my worst stay ever! The rooms was not clean, the heating and cooling in the room was horrible and my towels and face towels only was changed once in 4 days. I will probably never stay her again."
"This is a beautiful hotel, great location, clean and comfortable room.  Patio is an amazing setting.  Bartender has serious skills.  We would definitely stay here again.  Perfect spot for a romantic getaway."
"Room was spacious, clean.  Meeting space was ample.  Food was always tasty.  Staff was exceptional.  I arrived a bit early from another state, and my room was available, which was an unexpected and pleasant surprise."
"This is an outstanding hotel,  comfortable bed, terrific conference center. Only one complaint -- the shower needs to accommodate a woman shaving her legs! No bench,  no shelf on which to rest one's leg. Other than that, had a wonderful experience."
Temperature control was an issue. Parking was a plus.  Noises from adjacent Beer Garden were loud and continued Thur the wee hours. Loved the staff. Close to where we were going but not sure I would stay here again.
This hotel is in a great location but needs some tidying up with some minor flaws. The bathroom and interior room needs better lighting. The walls and entry doors show some minor damage and peeling wallpaper.
"Great service, clean hotel! Great value for the price. This place worked perfectly for our trip to the Blade Show. The shuttle driver, Harold, was absolutely amazing. 

Staff was wonderful and the complimentary breakfast and reception was a nice touch!"
Everything was great. The room was new and clean. The staff went out of their way to make it a good experience. We were there for business and the shuttle service saved us a lot of trouble. The breakfast buffet was top notch.
The Westin is a great hotel in an even better location. The rooms are very spacious and the beds are extremely comfortable! The bathrooms need a little updating but I would definitely choose this hotel again!
The staff was great and the service wonderful. The room was clean and the food was delicious.   The beds were nice and soft and you didn't want to get out of them.  They made you feel welcome and your  business appreciated!!
"Very comfortable bed and updated suite room. Includes couch, desk/chair, two flat screen TVs, kitchenette, climate control thermostat and wireless internet.  Wonderful friendly and helpful staff.  Spent most of my time in the hotel and very much enjoyed my stay."
"This hotel is conveniently located to the CNN Center, Georgia Dome, Georgia World Congress Center and Phillips Arena!  This hotel is small and cozy but very contemporary.  trendy decor and a very comfortable bed.  This hotel is perfect for a single traveler or a couple."
It's good you would provide personal care products upon required. But some of the products are expired. It will be great if you can check the products' expiration date before you delivered to the guest room.
"The hotel staff were friendly, the room was spacious & clean, and the food was delicious. This was a business trip for me but it accommodations made it feel like a personal trip.   Great place to stay whether it's for work or leisure!"
"Not clean, not the usual Embassy Suite quality Great location and shuttle service. Hateful management staff. Skimpy breakfast. Cheap snacks for reception FILTHY POOL lots of standing water. Many places to eat around"
"Staff was great but the hotel smelled, stained sheets, pool was dirty and our kids left the pool after 5 min. The eggs at the breakfast tasted horrible and it started with no plates and no silverware."
"The wall to wall carpet was quite Dirty. Otherwise it was a nice hotel with friendly personel and with a good location in the Midtown (if you want to live in central Atlanta though, this is not the hotel for you. Wifi was very bad."
"Excellent service by the staff.  Nice clean hotel - great location.  Dining staff and food was also excellent.  Joe, the omelet and waffle maker was quite the class act.  Would highly recommend to anyone traveling either for business or pleasure."
"No lobby, under construction, soda machines didn't work, parking lot was messy, people were nice. 

We checked in at dark but surrounding area was nice. Very close to a Starbucks and a Chick Fula. No free breakfast!"
My stay was brief however the service was awesome. Everyone was friendly and polite and this experience was definitely amazing. I had a last minute booking and I experienced no issues. I definitely recommend this property.
Very Pleasant Stay. Exceptional Staff! Close proximity to downtown.  In walking distance to to other restaurants and entertainment in the area. Access to Marta with direct access to Airport. Really enjoyed the stay.
"Updated, comfortable hotel located in the heart of downtown. Easy walk to restaurants, bars and various shops. The staff was friendly and attentive. And having a workout facility was a plus! My next visit in ATL will be here!"
"I choose the Hyatt House whenever I travel to Atlanta on business.  The rooms are spotless, comfortable and quiet.  Strong wireless connection throughout the property and into the parking lot.  Consistently excellent breakfast buffet."
This a rather trendy hotel and attracts quite a crowd at holiday time and the weekends.  If you are comfortable with this then you'll get along just fine.  The rooms are certailny quirky but well appointed.
The newly-remodeled room was just right for our family. Room was clean and beds were comfortable. The location is good with plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby. The breakfast area was very crowded on Saturday morning.
We are thrilled to hear that you and your husband had such a memorable stay with us and look forward to welcoming you back again soon!
Booked a room overlooking the airport and was not disappointed! Room was very large and balcony was pleasant. Cleanliness of the room could have been improved though. Nice breakfast and easy airport transfer
Nice place to stay they feed you dinner and Breakfast so it makes your budget last longer. The rooms  are very nice they gave me a 2 bedroom I did not need but it was nice if you had more people there.
"The Mandarin Oriental is a beautiful place to stay offering unrivaled calm and sophistication.  The staff, from spa to food service, are kind and attentive.  I give the hotel 5 stars and will stay here whenever I am in Atlanta."
"AtlantaEntertainment,

Thank you very much for your recent stay at Artmore Hotel. We really appreciate your kind words and we will share it with our staff. We hope to see you back again soon."
The Ellis staff makes the stay!  Room was lovely and our dogs were welcomed.  Ellis is near EVERYTHING!  Food was great too.  Can't believe we found such a great pet friendly hotel.  Atlanta trolley and a MARTA stop are just across the street.
The room was a little disappointing.  Faint cigarette smell.  It was quiet so I got good night sleep.  The restaurant was very good.  Great drinks! Food very tasty.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.
First time staying at this hotel. Great service. Very clean hotel will definitely stay there again. Convenient location to different restaurants and the Piedmont park. Quiet rooms and beautiful view from the upper floor.
"Great little getaway. Beds were comfortable, and room was clean. I did have a problem with the toliet and not enough towels but it was handled promptly. Will stay here again. I really enjoyed the pool although it was small"
The experience was awesome they were very friendly the valet was awesome the breakfast was delicious but the eggs were cold the room was very clean and the front desk clerk took care of everything the tv especially
The property seems a bit dated but the staff and service are very good. I would return. The location is perfect for midtown business meetings and dining out. Breakfast is average. Overall a good stay.
I booked hotel for wrong night on my corporate site and April not only fixed it but matched pricing at competitors site and put me in an amazing room. Room is a huge town house suite....suite is great..but April and service is even better!
"Hotel offers exquisite decor, spacious and clean Meeting and sleeping rooms. Restaurant service is incredibly slow. 15 min between empty drink and service. Table of 10, served by 1. Need additional attentive servers."
"DO NOT STAY HERE!!!  The hallway smelled of urine, the room was dirty, the bed was uncomfortable, there were shady characters lurking about at all hours, security was non existent, and the service was terrible."
"Management and staff outstanding.  Friendly, welcoming and always willing to assist.  Accommodations were clean and the housekeeper that took care of us was wonderful.  Stayed on the 4th floor.

A big thank you to Horace and the rest of the staff for always being hospitable."
"Nothing but good comments. All the staff, the convenience of location and the unique rooms will have me coming back! Wonderful  architecture  with attentive staff people. Free shuttle across the street. Many museums and restaurants in waking distance."
Trip to Atlanta for a conference down the street. I really liked the area the hotel was in. Just a short walk to the train and great food options near by. I would visit this hotel again! Right by aquarium!
During our stay we received excellent service. Would highly recommend it. The area is excellent with shops and malls nearby. The Aquarium and Coke Museum is a short distance from the Hotel.  Have stayed in other Ritz but this one was very good.
The location is good and the people are nice but Havolyn in the hospitality lounge is the best. If you don't have enough points pay extra. It is worth it. The bar is good and the food is good. Walking distance to several restaurants.
"Wonderful experience with the hotel but horribleness experience with paying. I wanted to pay cash but they already charged my card even though they only stated it was for incidentals. Other than that location was clean,  professional and I. The right are."
"It is an incredible hotel, very close to a MARTA stop in a very quiet area with a fantastic spa and swimming pool. The staff is also very kind and helpful. The breakfast menu is awesome.
If you can pay it, it is really worth!"
#NAME?
"Hotel is in desperate need of updating. The couch was visibly worn and when pulled out, horribly uncomfortable. The hot tub was a murky yellow color. The happy hour isn't worth it and the breakfast line takes FOREVER."
"Overall my stay was a great experience.  I do plan on returning with the family, so they may experience the hotel.  The staff was friendly and professional.  Mr. Lucus the right manager provided great recommendations on where to eat."
"Very convenient downtown location. Parking can be found nearby on a parking lot.
Rooms stylish and very nice with coffee machine, ac and all that is needed. Good international breakfast and helpful personell"
"Mark - 
From the moment you arrived until you departed our hotel, we're delighted to read your experiences exceeded your expectations. We look forward to welcoming you back for many more future stays.

Cheers,
Mark Castriota
General Manager
Loews Atlanta Hotel"
"We've stayed there for couple of nights when the Falcons played their last game with Panthers. The place is very nice and comfortable, great service, great breakfast and bar. We enjoyed our time at the hotel"
"Great staff, good value.  Stayed at this hotel many times while visiting Emory. Recently had car trouble and the called hotel for a ride back.  Driver of the hotel's van came with cold water while we waited for AAA in July heat."
Excellent service...great location....and very pet friendly. The butler service and reservations staff were very helpful...gracious and professional staff. Very lively bar scene...our poodle Teddy enjoyed his stay and there were close by dog walking areas that were well lit for early morning walks
Friendly staff great experience easy process in and out. Clean rooms. Plenty of room. Connected to mall made access to outlets easy and convenient.  Downtown location made it easy to walk to area surroundings .
We stayed here after the SEC championship.  The restaurant downstairs was really good.  The hotel was comfortable and clean.  The parking was free.  I would return again.  Was a lot less stressful then trying to stay downtown.
"Kind of fun navigating the open design but the elevators can make you dizzy! Hotel has good amenities; courteous, responsive staff; rooms are comfortable and quiet. Good location downtown but a hike to convention center. Rooms offer only one drawer!"
"Great location and service for this short stay.  I needed a quick stay prior to taking off from the airport in Atlanta and this was PERFECT.  Despite some remodeling, I did not hear any clamoring.  Clean rooms, accommodating staff."
Tom L we appreciate the kind review!  Thanks again for taking the time to give us a shout out. Cheers- Zach
"I was very satisfied with this hotel, it was clean and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel is close to many restaurants and places to go after being in meetings all day.  Definitely would go back and stay at this hotel again."
"Room was clean, comfortable and quite.  But at $149 per night one would think that the internet and breakfast would be included, but they are not unless you are an HH member.  The breakfast staff was very friendly and helpful."
"Visited  hotel during a recent business meeting. The rooms are wonderful, the satff is very helpful. We had a business reception also and the food was outsanting. This is a true gem and everyone that visits Atlanta should visit it."
"Excellent hotel to stay in ,welcoming stuff and very helpful.
Great location near the two malls and the attractions in Atlanta is not far .
Next time I visit Atlanta city definitely I will choose Mandarin Oriental Atlanta."
The hotel was reasonable priced and in a great location.  Walking distance to all of the major venues and convention center and Centennial Olympic Park. Very clean comfortable and a nice bar/restaurant.  Very friendly and helpful staff.
"Near the malls and highways.
Rooms are clean and unique.
rooftop bar/lounge is great.
Anytime I'm in Atlanta the W hotels provide the comfort and cleanness that I require.
I have stayed at all the W hotels in Atlanta and they are all good."
"I only wish their shuttle went to the Chastain Park Amphitheatre.  We did not want to try to park there and it was 1.8 miles outside their shuttle maximum distance.  Our room had a strange smell, we think it was from a previous guest cooking."
Everyone that I interacted with was incredible! The staff definitely made my trip! Everything was clean and modern. It was absolutely everything I was hoping it would be.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the city.
Our flight was cancelled (Spirit air) and we needed a hotel until we could get a flight the next day. The employees at the Hyatt were very helpful. The room was exceptionally clean and the bed was divine for two very weary travelers.
"Stayed as part of a Collette Tour and treated well.  Clean, airy environment with a professional staff. FIVE elevators to accommodate guests; the wait time was short!!  Great location for eateries & shopping!"
"The biggest plus for this property is that it's attached to the mall. I've stayed here many times for business. It's always comfortable and the concierge lounge is nice, but it feels a little stuffy and even cramped (not much room on the lobby level)."
The Mandarin Oriental was everything that I was  looking for in a Hotel. The overall experience was excellent and the staff was outstanding. If you're looking for a hotel with all the bells and whistles then look no further
"WeÃ¢ÂÂre sorry we fell short on a few things, Ted. WeÃ¢ÂÂd like to make it up to you and hope youÃ¢ÂÂll reach out to quentin.rucker@hyatt.com. We look forward to hearing from you."
Never again ! To many hidden fees then when you get there they hold $6o on your card they they charge $10 a night for a microwave the entire experience was ludacris then itÃ¢ÂÂs $22 a day for basic buffet breakfast
The details at the hotel were very nice.  The employees were very nice.  The noise form the road construction was so loud it woke us up at 2:30.  Also they are building a hotel next door.  Other than that it was a very nice hotel.
This hotels interior has been completely redone!!  Beautiful entry way with modern style guest suites.  The complimentary breakfast was delicious and the complimentary managers reception with drinks is a great place to meet other guest on work travel!!!
"Family visited for husbands business trip. 2 room suite nice but nothing spectacular. Dirty dishes for room service to pick up sat for days. Beds were very comfortable. Noise level high! 
Is convenient to see the sights in Atlanta"
"We really appreciate your comments, thanks for telling us about your stay, please come again soon"
"We stayed for a weekend and were in a convenient place for all of our events.  The staff were accommodating. The property was well maintained, quaint and lovely.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay again."
Didn't get the handicap room I had reserved and it was a real problem for us. Not told this at checkin. Found out when got to room. Did give us a $50 discount on room but didn't help with stay. Needed handicapp room.
Great hotel and lovely staff!! Assistant General Manager Kinyatta is awesome!! This hotel provides a free shuttle to attractions that are in a five mile radius of the hotel. There was a various breakfast selection. The breakfast was hot and well prepared!!
I really enjoyed my stay. It was Spring Break. I needed a place to get away. I needed to get my mind off work and everything. I did just that. I could not have chosen a better place to stay. I had so much fun!
"Went to Atlanta for a business meeting, stayed at Aloft. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by China Grant. The welcome was warm and I felt at home. I would  highly recommend Aloft ask for China or Andrean"
Absolutely loved this hotel! Clean and beautifully decorated. The location was perfect for walking to all of the downtown attractions. The evening social was a great bonus. Breakfast was very good. Our suite was clean and very comfortable
"Stayed here two times in the last month, and was very happy with the location, cleanliness, food, sleep, HVAC, etc.

Morning breakfast in club was good.  The parking ramp is in rough shape, but if you can overlook that, it is a nice place."
Wow - what great comments!  I'm so glad Ernest and the rest of the team were able to help you get to the wedding on time!
"We were in Atlanta the second week of June for a swim meet at Georgia Tech University.
The Location is great, the staff friendly and helpful, the dining options were very good.  We loved breakfast at Community Smith."
"This Hotel s an excellent hotel. The price is excellent, the food is excellent and the staff is wonderful and kind. If you are ever in the Atlanta area stay at the HGI Wildwood. I know your stay will be a enjoyable one."
"The staff was wonderful when we arrived and was great during the departure.  Our vehicle was safe and no issues when we arrived back from our 10 day excursion in Seattle, Washington and Alaska.  The rooms were clean."
"This is my new fav Atlanta Hotel.  It's my second time staying here on the holiday weekend and I'm so glad we shifted, because it's a much better hotel.  The staff really goes out of their way to make it an enjoyable trip."
Excellent value. Very clean and well-equipped rooms. The staff is excellent - friendly and accommodating. The complimentary breakfast is very convenient and better than most. The location is extremely convenient if proximity to the airport is important.
Last minute booking for a late night arrival.  Easy check-in and check-out including a very nice concierge host manning the desk in the morning.  Good breakfast.  Overall nice stay.  Room was clean and well furnished.  No complaints.
"The  Hotel was good in most aspects, good location, decent food, hotel staff was polite, there are some improvements to be made to the rooms.  Overall I would recommend to others.    It is within walking distance to most major downtown Atlanta attractions."
This is the hotel I always use especially when i'm traveling very close to the airport and their shuttle runs all the time I do recommend this hotel. Great staff and the food in the restaurant is great the bartender makes awesome drinks!
"The Pinnacle Hotel in Georgia for any special occasion, Thanks for an Awesome weekend Dawn T. We had a great time. The staff did an excellent job and everything locks so authentic as well as classy
B.B."
"The hotel was clean and is undergoing a renovation.  The room appeared to need an upgrading, the dÃÂ©cor and finishes were tired and needed to be freshened.  Hope that it will happen.  Location was good to our business needs."
"Excellent in comfort, location and service! I would highly recommend for anyone that loves quality and needs a good rest! The concierge letÃ¢ÂÂs you know about becoming a member which helps you get discounts not to mention the great restaurant!!"
"I have no complaints, service was great! Hotel looks great! I stayed on business and it was very close to The Cobb Centre which is where I spent most of my time while I was there, it's right around the corner."
"This is a nice hotel easy to get to off of the interstate on the outskirts of Atlanta.  We were very pleased with our room.  We did not cook, but there was a full size refrigerator and kitchen.  Like a mini house.."
Great and comfortable room.  Bed was very nice as well as pillows.  Decorated well and 21st century-like.  Good ambience in lobby and spacious.  Bathroom was as expected for a Loews.  Great location and close to great ATL nightlife.
Stayed here in January. This place needs an upgrade. Rooms were worn out. Best thing about the hotel was the managers reception. Breakfast was confusing and food was not what you expect from a Embassy Suites.
"I loved this place for its charm (elevators, interesting architectural design, main lobby decor), but I hated the outside construction and near impossibility of finding a place to temporarily park for unloading."
"Staff is excellent. Angela in concierge is attentive to your needs. Clean rooms and all the amenities. The concierge lounge has computer, nice Wi-Fi, quiet and good food for breakfast and the evening meal. Check in here and you won't be disappointed."
"I was surprising my wife with an anniversary flight to Key West and was highly pleased with the location, airport shuttle, and staff. Especially Amber, who helped make our short stay (1night) nice. Will stay here again."
This is a great location with great service where everyone tried hard to make it a comfortable stay. Front desk welcome and departure assistance made the difference in a memorable trip. Christmas event made it even more special.
"I enjoyed myself. Just wish staff understands their jobs is to service the next customer in line, regardless of gender or race. Fix those issues and have continuous training modules and your company will remain at the top."
"Marie at the front dresk was great. She was extremely helpful in regards to the stay, transportation throughout the city, and with local food/attractions."

"Extra large room with great amenities, 2 large TVs, large bathroom, sitting area, microwave, small refrigerator.  Across the street from the Galleria, next door to Cumberland Mall, walking distance to Suntrust Park, lot of dining options within a mile.  Great view from room."
"We truly appreciate you comments and glad to hear that found the hotel a great choice for your stay. We look forward to having you stay with us during for your next concert night out.

Thank You,"
"Easy! Easy to find everything. Extremely convenient. Friendly, professional staff. Clean. What more needs to be said! I think I've said it all without worrying about two hundred characters. Perhaps this survey is the only thing that needs to be improved!"
"Located right in the middle of downtown Atlanta. we walk to the nearby attractions. Front desk was nice and helpful, room was okay, nothing to talk about, but clean.  No complimentary breakfast nor no free parking.  Parking cost $30.00 a day or Valet for $40.00."
Very friendly people here especially carlotta and April. Great clean room & even better breakfast. Valet was on time. Just a all around great hotel. Looking forward to my next visit. Thank you again April & Carlotta.
The experience was amazing. All staff were courteous and professional. Room were very nice and cleaned daily. The Breakfast and evening social was a great plus; which did had more options for vegetarians. I would recommend and stay here again.Ã°ÂÂÂ
"The staff, room and food service was superb! Room clean and bed was so comfy. I needed maintenance to change a battery and they arrived in ten minutes. Room service was affordable and quick. I'm a light sleeper and my room was very soundproof"
This property was very clean and allowed easy access to downtown. Very friendly staff especially the parking attendants and the breakfast staff. Everyone was very helpful and went out of their way to make sure that you were comfortable at all times.
"Clean, nice, convenient, comfortable, affordable, friendly.  Always stay here on business trips due to location and overall feel of the hotel.  Used to live in Atlanta and still come back to this hotel."
"This hilton located near the airport in ATl . Near lots of food places.nice breakfast in executive lounge. Nice fitness center and computer area. 
Very friendly staff at check in Parking is nineteen dollars ."
"The staff is very friendly. My favorite aspect of the hotel was the bathroom. I loved the glass, walk-in shower.  Very spacious.  The room was nice too. Comfortable bed. Loved the floors. Food in the bar is decent. I would not mind staying here again."
The ritz was not up to it usual level of elegance. The concierge lounge did not need the typical expectation of food quality and variety. A business hotel. Not for families.   No shopping or other amenities nearby
The bed linens are decent. I found the water pressure in the shower went out pretty far. The highlight is really the restaurant. I recommend ordering off the menu and not eating from the buffet. The eggs benedict really stand out.
Customer service at this Omni is phenomenal! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. ItÃ¢ÂÂs conveniently located near the Mercedes Benz stadium; within walking distance. I highly recommend staying here.
"We are glad to hear that you had and Excellent stay with us and that our team made you fell welcome and took good care of you.  We look forward to having you stay with us again in the near future.

Thanks,"
"Large, clean and well located airport hotel. Good location for downtown and areas south of Atlanta. Rooms are clean and offer good work spaces, The hotel is setup well for the bleary yes traveler and the staff is friendly."
I always stay at Embassy Suites hotels when available in area where I am visiting.  With the complimentary breakfast and manager's reception the rate is worth it.  You can always depend up getting a top quality hotel
"Everything clean and comfy! Enjoyed the pool and hot tub also the free meals. I would like to thank Mike the shuttle driver for his hard work! I will absolutely stay here again when I am down here for Delta Air Lines training. Thanks, Dale."
"Went to attend wedding in the midtown area and the hotel was chosen because of where situated excellent service all staff extremely help  and pleasant and nothing was too much trouble 
Giving advice on best shopping areas and transportation"
"Thx. so much for your comments. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay, and our great Buckhead neighborhood. Please come back and stay with us again!"
"Convenient to airport but entrance does not face the road. Bed extremely comfortable. Ac/heat relatively quiet. Adequate electrical outlets good for business travelers. Breakfast was good, tables constantly cleaned."
I need to travel for business purposes.  The room had very comfortable amenities making it a pleasant experience for which to work.  The rooms were very quiet so working and sleeping were very easy to do.
Stayed here because of a relative's surgery at Emory Hospital. The room was very nice and clean. Very accommodating staff. Shaquille was great! Would recommend to anyone staying in the area for similar purposes.
The rooms are immaculate and luxurious. Real impressed with the gratuity gifts placed in room upon arrival the candied pecans and truffles where amazing. Staff is so inviting and realy makes the stay awsome. I recomend this hotel to everyone..
"Stayed here for three nights.  Great location  easily accessible by MARTA from the airport.  Staff was friendly and the accomodation comfortable.

Close to shÃÂ²pping and entertainment with Lenox mall next door.

The food and beverage at the hotel are great and the service exceptional."
Stayed my first time here on business. Was convenient to the Cobb Galleria Centre. Worth the difference from one of the cheaper hotels in the rewards family. My new go to hotel in Atlanta. Great Breakfast.
"Great location: just a short walk from the North Avenue MARTA. Good service, fast wifi, and clean if basic rooms. For me it was a great stepping stone before my more long term accommodation was available."
"Great new hotel with clean, spacious, well-appointed rooms. Bed was comfortable and bathroom was spotless. Only (slight) negative was street noise. But, that's to be expected in downtown Atlanta. Still slept well. A great option for an Atlanta stay."
"Only stayed for one night, but Country Inn and Suites had the cleanest hotel rooms IÃ¢ÂÂve ever stayed at. The marble look in the bathtub were a nice touch. They had very nice staff members. And wonderful complimentary breakfast. Ã°ÂÂÂ"
"Nothing is as it is stated or shown!!  All false information and advertising except that there are rooms... not any you would want to stay in, but there are rooms and there is seemingly a hotel holding them!"
Stayed here one night prior to my husbandÃ¢ÂÂs surgery at Emory.  Easy access to hospital and freeways.  Close to downtown if needed. Ample parking.  Nice restaurant and bar.  Large portions of food.  Very helpful and attentive staff.
"The bed was very comfortable, the shower was nice, hot water! quite room! Loved the television in the bathroom, liked the alarm clock with the cell phone adapter, every staff member I encountered was smiling and very approachable!"
"I want to personally thank the amazing staff on the 21st floor who run the Intercontinental Lounge. To Thaddi, Ness, Bianca and Brandi - thank you for taking care of me for the entire week. You made a wonderful stay even more enjoyable."
"Great hotel for a good price. Comfortable beds, great breakfast, and relaxing atmosphere. Everyone was nice. They asked if we had AAA which helped us get a discount on our room. Not many places will ask you. Job well done to this place."
"Awesome place with awesome employees like Tiffany and Marquis! Funny and really good people.
I would recommend this hotel to everyone, the rooms are good and the bar is a good place to pass the time! 10 out of 10"
Nice treat coming from the Masters! Easy to get in and out of from the interstate systems. Overall staff was very attentive and hospitable! Great neighborhood that surrounds the hotel with plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from.
Janet made our visit extra special. She was able to check us in early and give us a room that accommodated our group size without issue. We enjoyed a girls night out Christmas in November celebration!
"We are glad to hear that you had a wonderful stay with us and delighted to hear that you enjoyed your deluxe suite.   We look forward to having you stay with us again in the near future.

Thanks"
I stayed here on business for a few nights. The hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly. I enjoyed the breakfast with cooked to order eggs and make your own waffles. I would stay here again when traveling to Atlanta.
"Overall this was a great hotel.  The customer service was amazing and it was a very comfortable stay. Good location, great shopping, excellent area restaurants.  easy access, needs better room service menu choices"
What a fabulous review! Have you tried the Ricotta flat bread appetizer or the Cocktail kit at Cook Hall? They are to die for!
"I really really enjoyed my stay! Ms. Michelle went above and beyond to accommodate my friends and I! She was very pleasant, informed and quite funny... Double Tree (Atlanta Airport) yes I would recommend you to others!!!"
"Bartenders awesome conversations, host gave great attraction and food suggestions checked in after 4:30 and the nightshift were the best!!! Great like-home hot breakfast with a good variety of food. Location was great with great view of downtown. Would recommend 100%"
Four Seasons always treats me nicely when I arrive. It's great to have a central location with a beautiful room and be able to walk to certain events like the Atlanta jazz festival. Great service great hotel
"June 2018 stay - unfortunately this hotel, at least Building E is substandard for its location in the metro Atlanta area and price.  Shoddy, sloppy appearance, musty odors, dis-repair.  I stay at many hotels, this is one of the least desirable I've been to."
"Beautiful hotel decor and terrific suites. Nice meeting rooms, wonderful breakfast and evening happy hour reception. Food catered by the restaurant for our business lunches was always well prepared and delicious."
"Stayed here for Dragoncon. Housekeeping never serviced room, was told they are subcontracted and leave at 3pm. Omelet station and breakfast was a joke. I will be looking for a new hotel for next year."
"Convenient for the airport/conference centre/ car rental centre, modern design, clean, attentive & helpful staff, nice bar, good breakfast menu, relatively spacious & clean rooms, well priced....all in all a good first stay. And we already booked our next stay."
Beautiful hotel!  LOVED the wine down half hour everyday from 5:30-6pm...$1 wine/glass. The hotel is right on Peachtree - where all the downtown activities are. Staff is VERY friendly and helpful. Well managed establishment.
I checked in at the hotel and things were very friendly from the time I checked into the time I leftÃ¢ÂÂ¦ The room was immaculately clean ...I love the way they remodeled all the rooms it looks really great !!
"Great staff,food,and rooms. 
I must say the staff is very great. The restaurant has a great buffet for breakfast and lunch. Along with additional food spots. There is a great pool and exercise room. The location is great and close to MARTA."
Had an overnight stopover in Atlanta and stayed at the Crowne Plaza. Shuttle service to the hotel is good but we hardly slept a wink as the road outside is so noisy.  Room was OK but changed our booking for our return trip.
We are glad that you enjoyed your stay with us. Looking forward to hosting you again whenever your travels brings you back our way!
Would never stay at this Embassy Suites again.  My sisters had a room as well and had the same issue plus no soap.  Maintenance never showed up and my sisters were never delivered soap.  Was only a 1 night stay but still annoying.
"Had a very pleasant stay. The room was really cleaned, big and the staff were extremely friendly. The hotel had an idoor pool which was a plus and the hotel is  relatively close to the Lenox mall and other shopping areas.  Will stay here again"
Thx. so much for your comments. We have let our team know. Thx. for choosing us. Hope you'll stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead!
Great hotel and staff.  Breakfast is amazing.  The rooms are really nice and the bathroom is roomy.  Always a great stay.  The shuttle driver was very helpful in getting us to and from our destinations.  He was the bomb.com.
We apologize for any check-in delays you may have experienced during your stay! We hope you will accept our apologies and stay with us again.
I was most impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. It's rare to see consistency across departments and over several days. The location is great too with access to great dining within in walking distance.
Sleeping rooms are well decorated and very comfortable.  Self parking is available but vastly overpriced.  Restaurant has limited menu with excellent food and professional/personable service.  Hotel grounds and outdoor pool are well done.
"The suite was spacious and worth the extra price. Had a dining bar, corner sofa and kitchenette. Breakfast was full and good, came with room every morning. Close (~8 min) walk to Georgia World Congress Center."
Chosen by our tour operator . Not an ideal location and room small and bathroom very small. Furniture inc wardrobe really substandard . Breakfast area poor and choice very limited . Would not have gone by choice .
Very nice clean room with all the amenities. The employees were all responsive and helpful and the location is very good. We had the three bedroom suite with two full baths. I would recommend this for any family gathering.
"The attention to detail and the amazing location of this property makes it a great business destination, and a great leisure travel destination. Attached to the Atlanta Braves baseball stadium and surrounded by a village of shops and restaurants enhances the convenience."
"We truly appreciate your Great comments about our team and our hotel.   We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thank You,"
"Needed to stay overnight because of fligth connections. Friendly staff, fine breakfast, ok room, spacious, free shuttle service. Great price. IÃ¢ÂÂd happily stay again next time i have a lay-over in Atlanta"
"Wow, great experience, staff made everyone feel appreciated. They go out of their way to make sure everything is good, and the daily reception was a unexpected bonus. Great overall experience I would go back without hesitation."
"Hotel experience was good all round with no real weaknesses. Staff were cautious and helpful, with rooms and general hotel condition very good. The bed was a little firm but that is just a personal preference rather than a fault."
Tyler Forsyth checked us in and took care of all our needs. He went above and beyond to make our stay special! Massages were great and hotel was very nice! We plan to return to this hotel again very soon!
"We always enjoy hearing from  our guests and would like to thank you for
 posting such a pleasant review. We are looking forward to hosting you again on your next trip to our area."
This hotel had a great lobby & restaurant & the food was really good. The breakfast buffet was also very good. There were people partying on our hall and banging doors and being loud in the hallway all night so that was the only downfall.
Nice new hotel with very easy access to the airport good restaurant with modern amenities. The Verizon cell service was very poor and hard to hold a business call. Work is needed here. Without a Verizon upgrade I will find it hard to stay again
I expected the Hyatt Regency Atlanta to be top notch just as it always has been and found the experience just about perfect. All of the staff was friendly and made mine and my granddaughter's stay A1.
"This is the 5th stay for me at the Artmore.  It's a great location if in town for Midtown Music and a good location in Midtown.  Clean rooms, great staff, and surprisingly quite even during the festival weekend.  Would definitely recommend!"
"I stayed at the Hyatt July 2018 for one week. It was a business trip so I decided to upgrade to a Crown Suite since I would be spending time working in the room at times.Clean & updated,felt like home"
"Absolutely amazing!!! The staff is exceptional and the views are gorgeous! Girls night and we had a wonderful time. Every staff member we came in contact with was friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. We are planning another weekend getaway soon!"
"Rooms and bathrooms are poorly lit, lobby is more like dorm lounge than hotel.  Staff are very nice and location is convenient but the hotel seems like an economy property in a high end neighborhood.  Would not choose it again."
"irenegarside,

It is wonderful to hear that your experience with Four Seasons Atlanta was exceptional. Our staff are pleased to know that they made your stay enjoyable. We hope that you will return again soon!

"Conveniently located in the heart of ATL
Friendly Staff
Rooftop bar is a great place to start the evening.
Parking is difficult Valet is $32
Walking distance to many attractions, places to to dine.
Heart of ATL"
Room was great with a nice view (previous visit i was staring at the parking lot).  Yannick at the front desk was extremely professional and accommodating. Donnel the valet was quick retrieving my vehicle and gave great directions. Will stay again.
"Very enjoyable, amazingly comfortable  accommodations. I can't say enough good things. This line of hotels will remain my permanent choice.   I didn't expect to enjoy my stay to the extent that I did.   Must admit, I was skeptical."
"This was hands down the ""BEST"" hotel I have ever stayed in. Will for sure make the trip again. Remarkable suites, amazing hotel staff, great price/value, close in proximity to Downtown Atlanta and outstanding service. A++"
"We appreciated having you stay at our hotel. I will pass your comments on to the team, thanks for traveling."
Friendly and helpful staff.  Clean and comfortable.  Very convenient to Emory hospital and the Emory campus.  Walk or take the hotel shuttle.  Plenty of good restaurants and bars nearby.  I loved the ample fitness center and indoor pool area.
The hotel is well equipped and clean with all the facilities that are required. Not being able to book another Embassy from a dedicated computer link was a pain in the backside but not fatal to the overall experience.  Staff were pleasant.
A little older but still in fairly nice condition. Breakfast was good and nightly reception was great. People were mostly great. Only real negative was the lack of parking. You could forget finding something close to your room after about four pm.
Last minute family trip with my hubby to BB Hair show.. The Hyatt downtown is beside two great restaurants. The only thing that I didn't like about the hotel is that the bathroom is really small but clean.
"This is a wonderful hotel.  It is clean, big, great indoor/outdoor pool, great exercise room, great restaurant, great workers.  We will be staying here again.  ALL of the workers speak to you and are courteous"
Stayed here during renovation a couple of years ago and was pleasantly surprised to see how great the finished product came out.  Very modern and bright with a more cheerful mood.  The new look translated into better attitudes from the workers.
"We were staying at another high end hotel and were sorely disappointed by our treatment at this other hotel.  So, we moved to the Four Seasons and were graciously welcomed.  The room was magnificent and the food at the hotel restaurant was delicious."
"Great location. Right off interstate. Near shopping and downtown Atlanta too. Staff friendly. Nice buffet breakfast. 

A little noise from construction but not too distracting since not in the hotel during the day. Nice outside area for relaxing. Also outdoor pool and inside fitness center."
"Good Day:
   Whirlpool needed filter cleaned out.  Its now running like a charm"
"Very clean and comfortable rooms. The pool is a nice size, breakfast was great. The staff was wonderful and free shuttle to a 3 mile radius. It was about 19 minutes from CAU, were I was taking my daughter to for school."
"I enjoyed the wings so good, that I ordered them again the following day for lunch.  
The staff was very friendly, and this hotel made me feel like I was home.  I enjoyed the manager's reception.
I will stay again!"
"Great place to stay. Close to sporting events and Marta.  Great restaurants nearby.  Would recommend this to business professionals as well as families.  Close to centennial park and gift mart, CNN, Coke and many more spots."
"If u stay here, be sure to check the beds and dressers for ants and please don't leave food out because the ants will take over it before you take a bite. This was the Worse  4 night stay at an embassy in my life."
"Excellent service, overall  cleanness excellent, would recommend highly.  Staff very friendly and knowledgeable about area and points of interest. Definitely would go back.  I enjoyed my stay at the Grand Hyatt."
Valet hit my car n I still havenÃ¢ÂÂt received money for damages to my vehicle I called so many times every one keeps giving me the run around like nobody knows what is going on lawsuit will be filed if they donÃ¢ÂÂt fix my car
Nice hotel with free parking and buffet breakfast!! As well as an evening reception with snacks and beverages. The location was only 10 mins from downtown ATL and the staff was very friendly. The rooms were nice and spacious and not to mention clean.
"Nice place in downtown Atlanta.  Just north of Underground.  Basically on the edge of the nice tourist areas.  Big rooms for downtown, but small compared to most Residence Inns.  Clean, quiet, comfortable.  Valet parking."
"Sweet hotel with a fabulous courtyard and amazing rates, pet friendly to boot!  Excellent location!   Really unique rooms!  Courtyard has lots of shade and a fabulous water feature, so soothing I don't feel like I'm in midtown hotlanta!"
"Homewood Suites is the Best hotel in the country.  The location was great and the staff was helpful and friendly.  
 
I was visiting Atlanta October 27-29, 2017, and I stayed in the Microtel in Brookhaven. That was the worst hotel IÃ¢ÂÂve ever encountered."
the staff was great.   All of the room types were spacious and up to date.  In room service was prompt even during rush hour on a holiday weekend.    Great location to the stadium.  The hotel offered car service for a 3 mile radius .
The service was grade A from checking in until checking out. My husband and I came back rejuvenated after staying there. This hotel is literally across the street from the Georgia Aquarium. The location is great.
"Clean, spacious, great customer service, comfortable bed and great price."
"Such a nice hotel, considering the location,  Downtown Atlanta which is crammed full of mega hotels for the purposes of conferences. In easy walking distance of the conference centre without having to take part fully in its soullessness."
"Great place to stay, we had a great visit to Atlanta. It is the perfect location. Within walking distance to most everything we wanted to visit. The staff was super nice and very accommodating to my family."
"The people were friendly. The room was nice and the location was perfect. I walked to the Coca Cola museum, Centennial Park. The Ferris wheel and the Phillips Arena. The breakfast was good and the cocktail reception was fine."
"Lovely room, spacious, and very clean. We have already decided that we'll be back in the very near future. Great location-- very close to shopping, an array of restaurants, and has convenient interstate access."
I wouldn't recommend this hotel  if you are travelling with family. I think you have to pay extra to get good response from their staff and each and every house keeping service. Parking is also very expensive as compare to other garages in Atlanta.
"Great Place Great Location Great Front Desk. Awesome inside with plenty of lounge areas. Close to bars, food and sightseeing and the rooms are super clean and very quiet.  Walk to everything. Hotel just opened this year and I will be back."
We are glad you enjoyed the peaceful tranquility of our property. We like to say we are a jewel hidden in the heart of the city!
"Great Experience!!! Room was very clean. Stayed in a two bed, two bath suite with a view of the city. Although I wish they had some sort of roll away bed for last minute guest but Overall stay was awesome."
"Excellent accomodations with new remodeling effort. Staff was great and apologetic for inconvenience of remodeing effort. Once remodeling is finished, should be outstanding. Outstanding choices for the new hotel decor."
We are happy that you chose to stay with us at the Hyatt House Cobb Galleria and we are glad that you enjoyed your stay.  Please come back again when back in the area.
Michelle was awesome and provided our Sorority with the best customer service. I am impressed with the Georgia hospitality. We will be back next year and hopefully the year after as well. Unlimited cookies are the best
Everyone was very nice and the hotel is the definition of five star. everything was perfect and the st. regis has one of the best hotel rooms in ALT. Again the service was great and the people were great
"The service provided was excellent for this property, one of the best I have experienced at a Marriott.  The property has been remodeled and the rooms are standard for a Marriott.  O good business hotel.  Plenty of good places to eat nearby."
"This hotel is nice and in a convenient location.  Comfortable bed with nice amenities.  Parking is overpriced at $32 per day.  Front desk and valet service was prompt and pleasant.  

Shower water was cold and dial in temperature control poorly designed."
My overall stay was great. The staff was very helpful. The facility was secure. The only issue I had was the internet service was a little crappy.  I would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends.
Very smooth check in and check out process.  Very quiet for the most part and a great location.  Being in Midtown gave us access to everything we did during the Memorial Day weekend.  Everything was 10 minutes or less.
Our apologies for not exceeding your expectations. We will discuss these comments at the next managers meeting.
WouldnÃ¢ÂÂt stay anywhere else for DragonCon or anytime going to Atlanta. Staff is very friendly and wasnÃ¢ÂÂt at all intimidated by a bunch of people in costumes. If fact they seemed to enjoy it. The breakfast is first rate.
"Expected much better in customer service - rude staff at breakfast. Terrible internet service - even with the Premium option. For the cost of this hotel, expected more. The location is great, but the staff was not."
Our room was lovely and service was amazing! Would stay again and again....very big suite and worth the extra money. We did have to wait to check in because we arrived before the afternoon check in time.
The carpet was somewhat aged but the staff was courteous. The restaraunt had a decent pulled pork sandwich but somewhat pricey. Gated lot cost an extra12 per night but secure. Close to the south suburbs!
"This is a beautiful hotel and the staff is very friendly. However, if you get a room on the street side you will not sleep well due to the traffic noise that doesn't stop until about 2:00am no matter what floor you're on."
Love everything about this hotel. Only thing is I didn't like the ginger creme brÃÂ»lÃÂ©e much. Felt the sugar could have been melted more. Need I say more? : )  Thanks Ritz-Carlton! Appreciate you taking such good care of me.
"What an ""AMAZING"" response. I hope you get to come back.  We loved having you here."
"The hotel was very comfortable, I pretty much slept the entire time :-)...food was good. The hotel is directly off the highway which is great."
"Good afternoon VolPrincess0422
Thank you so much for your very nice review!
We are glad to see that you enjoyed every bit of your stay.

I am looking forward to welcome you back soon!
Have a great weekend!
Tamara"
"We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Hope you can come again, soon!"
"The hotel is an amazing place.  One employee was outstanding doing her job.  That was Shauna, the housekeeper for our room, 1422.  In addition to doing an excellent job cleaning the room, she was personable, helpful and proud of her work."
"Travel every week for business, this is the only place I will stay in Midtown Atlanta. Lakesha is usually who works front desk when I check in and she is full of energy and positive which makes the work week much better for me anyway."
This is a great property have some good people that work there. Close to a lot of convenient Eaton's places mall shopping and they will take you anywhere within a 5-mile radius. I would recommend it 2 my friends.
"Great location for downtown Atlanta. No frills economic hotel. Nothing special. Just a solid, inexpensive stay."
"This hotel was clean, the staff were very nice and  friendly and it was conveniently located near the mall and other great restaurants. I would really recommend this hotel to anyone going to the Buckhead area."
"Stayed over a weekend with my daughter and granddaughter. Excellent location. Outstanding service. Great breakfast if you get a package that includes it. No pool. Great exercise room, sauna and steam room."
"The Intercontinental is my absolute favorite hotel when visiting Atlanta. The geographic area, hospitality and entertainment are that I need to have an awesome weekend. Courtney is always very helpful."
Nice hotel with convention space. Easy checkin and out. Be sure to ask for room close to elevator or you will walk a mile. Hair on floor in small bathroom. Large TV and comfortable beds. Plenty of plugs. Starbucks in lobby and ok convention food.
Flooring and tile work nice.  Comfortable bed but on a platform that allows the mattress to slide during the night.  Uncomfortable and minimalistic room furniture and decor.  Should have updated the toilet to be higher profile and add a grab bar for the shower.
Great service from beginning to end.  Our stay was very comfortable.  The room exceeded my expections.  I would recommend the hotel to anyone coming to the area.  The staff serviced us with a smile. Our staycation was great!
"We stayed for just one night while we were on our way to another destination.  The room was big, comfortable and clean.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly the ladies in the breakfast room.   The breakfast was perfect. I would definitely stay again."
Rooms are standard rooms and over priced. Asked for a room with a view when booked...we got a view of a construction site. Ordered room service and even the food was average...only saving grace is the Zen garden was amazing.
We were glad to assist in any way during this special time and you all looked beautiful!!
The Ritz-Carlton always meets or exceeds my expectations.  Staff is always friendly and welcoming.  The staff are like ninjas - they always seem to be right around the corner when you need something.  They anticipate your needs and do what they can to satisfy request.
"popped in while traveling through town, always a good experience, the staff was friendly and helpful, not an easy access but GPS got us there with no issue.  Delays due to construction but that can't be helped"
Reasonable hotel.  Good location.  Room could have been cleaner.  There was a smell in the carpet which was not great.  Otherwise was a good location convenient to anything in the city.  I may have just been unlucky with that particular room.
"Traveling through Atlanta and stayed here.The rooms have great new beds but rooms come with only two doubles or a king but not two queens. The hotel is completely smoke-free, which is great. It is conveniently located right off I-85."
"Staff are friendly, hotel is new and gorgeous and location is great.

Food is pricey in the hotel but lots of restos nearby and short rides to many good spots and points of interest
highly recommend this hotel"
"Great location to centennial park. Rooms were updated and clean. Beds were very comfortable and staff were friendly and accommodating. Would stay there again for sure and would highly
Recommend to anyone"
We stayed in a corner king bed room.  It was very spacious and clean.  The staff was always smiling and courteous!  It was a quick trip to see our daughter defend her dissertation and we walked everywhere.  There were many restaurants and shops close by.
"Great location and great staff! 
Breakfast staff is very friendly 
Hotel overall was very clean. 
Less than 15 mins drive from all Atlanta downtown attractions. Very convenient to get in and out. 
Few eating establishments near by as well."
"Very convenient and I made full use of the hotel shuttle to attend my client's office each day. Everything I want in a business hotel, good amenities, easy access, responsive staff and a good selection of dining options nearby"
"My visit to the American Hotel Atlanta Downtown was excellent! The entire staff was professional and courteous! The staff was upbeat and engaging. They had a great Happy Hour on Wednesday that entails free wine,  ever and cheese!"
I totally enjoyed my stay.  Very close to attractions and places to eat. The courtesy shuttle within close proximity to the hotel is an additional lovely touch.  The front desk staff were very professional and courteous.
The hotel was great and everything was beautiful. But we ordered room service and the burgers had us in the bathroom all night. We missed out on our event. I was a little upset. Hopefully the hotel will make it right.
Was put in room 207 and what a treat . The room was like being in a suite in the Ritz . The breakfast waffles were 4 star Michelin .
"Great service, beautiful (and large rooms), and perfection location near lots of shops.  I went for a work trip but would definitely go back for pleasure.  I even left my electronic toothbrush in the room, and they mailed it to me!"
The room and restroom was super spacious for the price!!! Although i stayed in the room overnight for an early morning flight. I actually enjoyed my room and would definitely choose to stay here again.
"First time stay at a Double Tree and I'll add them to my preferred list. Staff was very accommodating and professional.  Property was very clean and comfortable. Close to the MARTA station (within 2 blocks), nice local restaurants, shopping mall within a mile."
"Upon return of my car from valet parking for my trip back to Charleston, found the radio dead.  Too much of a coincidence that it would fail while in valet parking and not have resulted from some action on their part.."
"Nice spot to chill with your spouse. We enjoyed the Sky lounge drinks, live entertainment and awesome view of the city line.  Various restaurants are walking distance; not to mention the Mercedes Stadium is nearby.  And the beds are very comfortable."
"Breakfast is served in the attached steak house, which is a much nicer venue than the atrium.  The omelet chef was great, and personable.  Room was very dark and very quiet - good sleeping.  Staff was exceedingly friendly."
"The staff were all very friendly and prompt with their attention to details. The room itself was comfortable and had everything that we needed. It is a great location, I will definitely stay here again."
"I had a great time at Aloft. The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern. The staff was helpful and I especially loved the bartender. She was kind, helpful, and very personable. The freebies were awesome as well (such as water, toiletries, etc)."
"Okay upon check in was greeted nicely by Edgar, room was ready immediately even though I arrived a bit early. Suite was CLEAN and PLEASANT, no odours or odors!! Bed linen and towels were fresh and clean. Will definitely stay again when in town."
"Great location, amazing staff, nice amenities. We stayed here for a conference and were pleased with our experience. The skyline view rooms are awesome and worth the price. Our floor/room was quiet, clean, and modern."
"Nice hotel.  Clean and recently renovated.  The rooms are on the small size, but a very good deal at the $41 I paid through priceline."
The worst service I ever received. I would never stay here again and would advise anybody else not to stay here either. Didn't like that I had to pay for parking no complimentary breakfast just awful .
"Didn't feel safe leaving any valuables in my room, after it was burglarized the first day!  Make sure to check to see that your door lock engages/closes all the way.  The staff did their best to help, but"
"I feel completely refreshed after my stay at the Grand Hyatt.  Everything went smoothly from check in to check out. My view from the room was incredible, and I loved the Japanese Garden.  Hope to return again soon."
"My husband and I visited Atlanta for a little romantic getaway weekend, and found the Ritz to be a lovely ""boutiquey"" hotel.  The service was impeccable, and the location was perfect - just a short walk away from anything you'd want to do in Atlanta!"
"Great location, nice clean hotel. Staff was friendly and always wanting to help with any issues. It was a perfect spot for my extended family to come and meet. Nice breakfast but the area was a little small compared to other Embassy Suites."
This is a great hotel nice look and rooms. Food so far is good and staff is helpful and friendly. I have several more days on my business trip so I look forward to enjoying this hotel for a few days to come.
"Did not actually stay in the hotel, but availed a number of its facilities.  Held a share holders meeting here with the board of directors and voting share holders.  Staff took exceptional care of us and managed to keep it all under cover..  :)"
Excellent place and staff was truly concerned about service every guest received. I needed quite a bit of assistance preparing for a meeting and I could not have been successful without Ariana's asssitance.
Stayed here on a drive through Atlanta.  Very nice hotel... large rooms with really nice setup.  Large bathroom! Very easy to get to...Comfortable Beds.  They do charge for parking though.  Lobby serves Starbucks.
Staff was very friendly and helpful about the local area!  The room was clean and comfortable. Good location. Thumbs up in my book!
"The Hotel staff were courteous and very helpful.  Hotel was clean.  Sheets and towels were clean.  Location is excellent and easy to find. Close to restaurants, shopping and transportation.  Be prepared to pay for parking though."
"The hotel is fine. Rooms are large and functional. Bed is comfortable. It is a bit dated but that's fine. Most importantly, the staff is amazing and helpful. The front desk staff was superb. Nothing to complain about at all."
"We are glad we were able to take care of your needs and your stay was a great one.  We hope to see you again in the future!

Warmest Regards,"
"Good location just very expensive for the service. Breakfast wasnÃ¢ÂÂt included, no microwave or refrigerator.  The pool wasnÃ¢ÂÂt really clean. For $333 all that should of been included. Staff was nice tho. Very helpful."
The a/c didn't work. There was trash in garbage bags on the hallway floors.hotel is old and somewhat outdated. No in suite dining offered. Furniture old...hotel is isolated...inadequate parking...no one offered to assist with luggage
The staff is excellent and the rooms are clean and comfortable. I was greeted each day by an enthusiastic staff that answered every question and helped me with all my needs. The hotel was close to good restaurants.
The staff were extremely friendly.  Room was clean.  Loved the pool area and the complimentary shuttle to take us around Town.  The hotel was conveniently situated to the train station which we took Downtown and to nearby bars and restaurants.
Worst experience ever!!! Party in lobby all night. Unable to sleeep due to all the noise.Security useless! Reservation for 2 queens - did not accomadate. Gave us King room instead for 2adults and 3kids. Horrible experience.  Do not stay here!!!!!!
Room was very clean; staff was outstanding; bed was comfy; in-room jacuzzi tub was sooooo nice; parking was free; in-room coffee and bathroom products were top quality; hotel is very close to everything and the price was right. I will stay again
"Great location on PeachTree Road, among several 5 star hotels, however after the poor level of customer service I received. I will no longer patronize any of the IHG property's. Regardless of Religion, Race, or Sexual Preference, everyone deserves fair and equal treatment."
"The hotel was very nice, clean, and staff was helpful. Beds were excellent. Lots of people and action in lobby but never heard any noise once in the room. Very near the airport. Front office gave great directions."
"Great place to stay. The staff is amazing. Friendly, kind and genuinely interested in making your stay enjoyable. Ritz Carlton is the gold standard and lives up to its name at Buckhead. If you're traveling to Atlanta, check it out."
"Mandarin Hotel Atlanta is one of the best hotels out there. From a beautiful and imposing building to a crop of efficient and highly professional staff, it is worth every cent. Their Price is very competitive."
"Eliana, Almaz, and Danielle were great helpers restocking the food at the event we attended.  They always made sure everything was out and displayed nicely, and they have a very pleasant and friendly attitude."
My husband and I recently had a layover in Atlanta and stayed at the Renaissance Concourse.  The rooms were very clean and well maintained.  The shuttle to and from the airport was very convenient.  We did not hear any plane traffic.
"Hotel was clean and staff was friendly. Has a bar and restaurant. Nearby attractions, Ferris Wheel, CNN World Hq, Aquarium, Phillips Arena and Centennial Park are all within walking distance. 

Easy to get around and family friendly."
"This is a very comfortable hotel run by some of the nicest folks I've ever met.  Couldn't do enough to make the stay enjoyable, productive, yet restful. When I travel to the Buckhead area again, this will be my first choice."
"A quiet hotel - but very nice, modern. Just started charging $12  for parking.  The breakfast buffet is OUTSTANDING.  Hotel is sort of low key, in an office park, and a bit out of the way - but still well located.  A go to choice."
"What a wonderful comment, I am so happy that the team hosted brilliantly and engaged in helpfulness while you stayed with us. Thanks so much for staying and thanks for traveling."
"Great staff, excellent food quality and clean, well-appointed rooms. The staff are helpful and friendly and willing to do whatever it takes to help. Nice suite styling. It is a Great value for the price!"
"Excellent value with my corporate rate. Easy check-in, breakfast and Internet included and the front desk offered me free appetizers upon check-in. Clean and well appointed room as well. No complaints!"
"Stayed at the Westin Buckhead for a conference. Hotel is beautifully up-to-date, rooms are comfortable and quiet. Staff is pleasant and very helpful. Great hotel in a great location. I highly recommend it."
Wife and I stayed for business and have no complaints. All issues were handed ASAP. Pool abdominal gym were  very relaxing. Would stay again. Staff was great and the meals or social hours were enjoyable.
"Amazing property, I always try to stay when travelling through Georgia to see family in Florida. Location is always clean with impeccable service at a reasonable price for all that's included. Definitely recommend to travellers who havent had the pleasure of staying here."
"The room was clean and centrally located in downtown Atlanta. 2 blocks from the MARTA station, easily accessible. The room was a bit dark with little or low lighting, but I think that's normal for W hotels. Cool purple design."
"I highly recommend this hotel. It is conveniently located on the north side of town. It was stylishly decorated with modern furnishings. The staff were professional, friendly and very helpful. We enjoyed a walk around the 'garden/park area near the hotel."
I left my shoes in the room when i checked out and realized I had 5 hours later when I reached home. Security / housekeeping couldn't find it. I would've expected more from a 5 star hotel that charges over $250 a night.
We stayed at suite because my son graduation was held at the Cobb Galleria. This place was very convenient to the Galleria. The staff was very helpful and nice. The rooms were very clean and roomy. Great.
The rooms here are small but it is an old building and a boutique hotel.  The redeeming aspect is it's location right in the middle of downtown close to everything.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was average.
"If you are staying in the Georgia area, this hotel is fantastic. The room, facilities and breakfast was fantastic. I have stayed in many hotels since then and it only confirms my view of how good Georgia Tech is."
Great location to feel like you have arrived.  Visit the spa day to feel like a true star.  Their suites are amazing.  Also go when the have the ice skating. Truly a lovely place. They have a champagne toast every day around 6.
"This is an awesome location, near many restaurants, shopping and entertainment.  Suite was very nice and evening reception and complimentary breakfast make it a great value.  Love the suite concept. On an in-town get away to work on some personal goals, the space was perfect."
"Frequent traveler through Atlanta. Always stayed at different hotel. From now on I will be staying at the Renaissance. All the credit goes to Chantel, Walter, Ashley and the rest of the staff. They were amazing all week. Very impressed by the hospitality."
"Hotel needs complete makeover. Cracks and leaks and mold everywhere 
The staff was not rude like some of the reviews say but no overly helpful.  Valets yell at each other and the room service was not as good as you would expect for Ruth Chris"
This hotel has a lot to offer and is near several different types of resturants.  Our room had direct access to the pool area which was really nice. (Indoor/Outdoor Pool). The room was very comfortable with high ceilings.  I will be staying here again.
"Clean, updated, spacious and convenient location. Close to MARTA (2 blocks) and walking distance to Atlanta Station.  Would recommend-staff was very accommodating and friendly. Overall-a great value.  Internet was fast, hotel was on a busy corner but very quiet inside."
Excellent experience at hotel and we will return in the near future.Awesome staff and from arrival until leaving there was excellent service. This is truly a reflection of the professionalism that your staff displayed the whole time we were there.
Staff was Awesome!  Check was quick!  Felt safe even with late check in.  Wonderful stay!!! Grounds were well taken care of.   The staff was very personable and genuinely concerned about my having a great stay.
Excellent service from the moment I walked in. Superb facility. Just 3 blocks from GaTech campus. Near any restaurant or shopping you might desire. Easy access to major roads. 7 minutes to Atlantic Station.
"We had a great experience due to Ikia Martin, our assigned sales coordinator.
She handled all requests professionally, was very timely and complete in her communications and made sure i was satisfied with arrangements."
I was in town for a trade show at the Congress building. I parked my car and did not use it for 3 days. It was convenient to entertainment and great food. I would recommend this hotel. The WXYZ bar is nice on site.
The hotel was clean and beautiful.  The neighborhood was very nice.  The staff was friendly and very accommodating.  We stayed with a group for a basketball tournament but I would definitely stay in this hotel again!
Charging for parking and limiting evening reception to 4 drinks. The hotel has recently been redone- guess they are using savings at the bar and parking fees to pay for it.  Been coming to this location for ~15 years and now very disappointed.
Very reasonable for a perimeter hotel. Great bed. Nice sheets. Nice staff.  Free parking. All a very good experience.  And the TV was good on the room. Appeared to be very clean. Will definitely stay again!
From the time I checked into the hotel it was an amazing experience. The room was excellently laid out the big screen TV a definite plus. All the staff from the front desk to the housekeeper's everyone was top-notch courteous kind and helpful
I keep returning ! the service and kindness and genuine attitude of the staff makes this hotel fantastic! great food local beers and food makes it even more special ! I cannot wait to return! ideally located as well.
My family and I stayed in this room for one night and the room was very clean and well stocked for a family of 4 and the staff was very nice and professional. We enjoyed the pool and hot tub. We would stay here again.
This is a terrible hotel. Nice staff. But the hotel is old and worn out. Maintenance just about keeps things going.  Very expensive for what it is. Never ever will I stay here again. xyxyxyxyxyxyxy xytxyxyxyxyx xytxyxyxy
"Great, safe location with good walking and restaurants surrounding. Room was clean and everything was great quality. Comfortable Beds. Staff was incredibly kind and welcoming. I would return here in a heartbeat next time I travel to Atlanta."
"The property was awesome along with the staff and service.  The breakfast was very delicious - food was freshly made.  The location was perfect, near the shopping areas and restaurants.  Parking was convenient as well as in close proximity to rail transit."
"Really enjoyed the bar atmosphere,its patrons,and Jermaine Stanley,the bartender, and his conversation. He was very attentive and timely with his servings and table touches. Would definitely recommend the bar and its bites. Will come again!"
"We're so glad you enjoyed the cobbler! Thx. so much for choosing us. Hope you can join us again, soon!"
"Great Location, close to Lennox Mall and all sorts of restaurants. I had a few issues with my card, they weren't that accommodating but I got it straight. My room was dusty, but for the most part it was cool."
"I rally enjoyed staying at your hotel, it was for graduation. I will come back and stay again.  I will tell friends of what good service we had, my daughter and I.  Location was great for the graduation, food was good. weather was very good,"
Happy to learn you enjoyed tranquil night and enjoyed the convenience of being connected to Lenox Square Mall.  I do hope you will return and try our Nox Creek Lounge for dinner or lunch.  We have some very tempting menu items you might enjoy!
"What a great little hotel in downtown Atlanta! Perfect location in the heart of city. Very clean and crisp decor; good quality soaps, linens and style! The staffÃ¢ÂÂfrom door to room to restaurantÃ¢ÂÂprofessional and gracious!"
The rooms are extremely well kept and the overall experience was excellent. The staff are very well trained and helped us at every turn to make for an excellent 3 days. They displayed flexibility and bent over backwards to make sure we were successful!
Blackout shade not working. Didn't cover the whole window so was wide awake at 7 am on my relaxing sleep in anniversary morning.  The wife and I went to relax at the pool and immediately left as it was dirty.
It was a great experience. I was assisted by Tiffany. She had a vibrant personality and we will visit this very hotel again! The setting of the room was amazing and couldn't hear a peep from our neighbors!
"This hotel is very modern in style and the staff is wonderful! They are very helpful and nice! The hotel is conveniently located around eateries that are in walking distance, a plus for me and my husband!"
"Friendly staff, clean rooms, great location. Special shout out to Michael and the valet staff. MichaelÃ¢ÂÂs warm personality and superior customer service made coming and going a breeze! Thank you - amazing service!!"
"Stayed here while doing a speaking gig at Georgia Tech.  It's right on campus, and there's a Barnes and Noble with a Starbucks across the street.  Rooms are clean and service is good. The fitness center is nice.  I'd definitely come back!"
"If you are looking for a great location, incredible service, impeccable appointments, and a fine facility, then look no further than the Four Seasons Midtown. I travel a lot and this is a first rate stay."
"The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Very clean and well kept. I expected nothing less given the area that it is located in. Located not far at all from fine dining ,shopping and family outings. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
Great time and lovely room. Everything was fine. The valet also was friendly and timely. The rooms were very user friendly and the bed was very large. We had a very nice view of the city and I want to return.
"Incredibly small, neglected bathrooms.  Large variation in room size at the same price point (my colleague compared her room to an inner cabin on a cruise).  Unengaged and seemingly apathetic wait staff at both the bar and the restaurant."
This hotel is very clean and nice. The room is a nice size with a large tv. The bathroom was very clean. The valet parking is a little expensive but more affordable options very close within a 1000 feet.
we stay at the hotel for a weekend for a concert . we informed the staff we needed a taxi to get to he concerrt. that had it waiting when we went out side. very helpful. staff was great. rooms were beautiful........ very very clean
"Overall stay was very good.  Beds were somewhat uncomfortable.  Service and staff and very good.  Breakfast was pretty good, seem to run out of items and not restocked quickly.  Would stay again and recommend it."
"Happy that you found the location , service and our F&B amazing, we appreciate you traveling and appreciate staying with us."
"We recently stayed overnight at this airport north Hyatt hotel. I  love their breakfast selection and the room probably need some update even it is clean and comfortable.
Will stay again in the future."
"Alaiza and Cristina were wonderful!!  I had to check in early and they went above and beyond to get me into a great room.  I would recommended anyone to stay at this hotel, especially with the new ballpark across the street."
Clean rooms great service good food and best of all walking distance from everything such as restaurants malls and Atalanta braves stadium.  This hotel sells out all the time so if you want a room book early
The hotel was nice and so was staff the tub wasnÃ¢ÂÂt clean I actually cleaned it myself so I can take a shower. Please do better and be sanitary. Your customers health should be important I am a guess not a maid
My daughter and I stayed there for one and she absolutely loved it. She's 4 and really enjoyed the property and room. We wish the pool was open but we understand why it wasn't. The bed was comfortable and we slept well.
"Alyssa and Sharita at the Front Desk were EXCELLENT! They helped in every way they could to make sure my family stay was PERFECT! Suggesting shopping malls, places to eat and even activities near the hotel to keep from traffic. #ThumbsUp

Thank you again"
"The hotel was very nice and clean.  It was also quiet.  Plenty of towels in the room.  We only stayed one night, and really only slept and showered.  It is close to a grocery store and Waffle House."
Hotel is beautiful. Staff very helpful. Amenities very close by . Outdoor sitting area is arranged beautifully. This would have to be one of the nicest Hotels I have stayed in since I arrived in the States from Australia.
How amazing!  We love how much you enjoyed our signature WHATEVER/WHENEVER service!  We are very happy to have Lance as a member of our team and we can't wait to host you again soon!
"This hotel is good for one think...attending a Braves game. Beyond that, skip. Poor staff, up charge for everything including resort fee and $4.50 for cup of coffee in lobby. ***also music from the outside area plays until 11:30 and comes through the window."
This hotel is our home away from home when traveling. Staff from top to bottom always friendly and helpful.
This was my first time staying at a SPG property but it will not be the last. The property was well maintained and the support staff were awesome! I highly recommend this location and hope you experience the same.
"Every single staff member at this hotel is extremely friendly and accommodating! The bed was awesome, breakfast was great."
"Stayed here one night passing through atlanta. Nice location and great eating places quite close. Small pool but did the job. Great breakfast. 
Room was really good two bedroom and pull out sofa. 
Would stay again"
"We were greeted by Kerry and Annalee at the front desk and they both were super nice and helpful, giving us tips on places around the hotel. I would absolutely stay here again because of its proximity to highway. Rooms were well appointed and clean."
"Hotel was very clean and tidy. It was super close to Coca Cola world and CNN and was just around the corner from a delicious steak house. The staff were very friendly :) 
Would stay here again if we came back"
"Part of our mission team stayed before flying to Haiti. Beautiful hotel, friendly staff. Beds were very comfortable & room was spotless! It's very close to airport & we took advantage of the park and fly. We will definitely be staying there again!"
"We're so glad to hear our colleagues could be of service during your stay with us! They go the extra mile for our guests every day. Thx. so much for being our guest. Please come back again, soon!"
"I love this hotel it's one of the best places I've stayed and was very relaxed each night we stayed. The kitchen is exactly like my home kitchen, with stainless steel pots and pans, a great microwave, and awesome plates."
"This is the worst Embassy Suites location that I've experienced. Cleanliness and presentation of rooms leave a lot to be desired. Given the wonderful location of Buckhead, the hotel is not living up to expectations"
"Whiskey Blue, our rooftop lounge is so extremely popular (even with Atlanta locals) and we understand why. The skyline views are unmatched and the atmosphere is chic and relaxing. We can't wait to host you again soon!"
Warm and friendly faces upon checkin. Great location...on and off w/ ease. Rooms were neat and modern...theres no place like home but this was close enough. Few tour buses checked in..got a lil nosey in hallways but no reflection on the establishment!Ã°ÂÂÂ
"Stayed here for two nights.  One of the best hotels in Buckhead.  Excellent customer service, friendly staff, amazing fitness center, good room service, reliable wifi, nice executive lounge.  Everything you want from a business hotel!"
Staying weekly on extended project.  Rooms are spacious and quiet.  Full breakfast bar was delicious.  Pool area was large and spotlessly clean.  Decor is calming.  Slept well- rooms a/c works well.  Staff is pleasant and accommodating.
Very nice place. Enjoyed my stay. Very nice friendly people. Great service. Nice clean room and atmosphere there. Will come back soon. If you're ever in the Atl visit the Emory. A excellent choice for a hotel.
"Handy location near Atlanta airport, big rooms and fantastic breakfast. If you're looking for somewhere just to spend one night before/after a flight, the Hyatt Place is perfect. The fitness centre is also open 24 hours for those with jet lag!"
Great boutique hotel. Excellent location for night life and restaurants. Our room was small but nice and clean. Lobby and bar were nicely decorated with the lounge feel. Staff was exceptional on all levels. Will stay here again. Only complaint was the RV- sized bathroom.
"The rooms are fine, but the hotel is under construction and has jack-hammers going from 8am to 6pm. Don't stay there until construction is complete. The employee tried to help, but we couldn't even speak with each other, due to the noise,"
"Baseball visit to watch the Atlanta Braves, shuttle service was Awesome.  Check in person was real helpful, but too busy for 1 person.   Hallways are too cold even for summer.  Pool was cool, hot tub would be nice"
I would like to say that Hyatt Place have an excellent staff especially Nadia Taylor. She helped my wife to get a couple of ticket for the Aquarium on her computer. She treated us like we were part of her family. She is excellent !!!
"What a lovely surprise when a hotel really delivers! Walked to meetings and even squeezed in a quick trip to the Lenox Mall with the hotel courtesy van. Pleasant, efficient staff and nice surroundings."
Thx. so much for your comments. We've passed them on to our team. We're so glad you enjoyed your room and stay with us during Atlanta Mania. What a great group! Please do come back and stay with us again!
Service was terrible. I called numerous times about the broken remote and it was never replaced. The room / bathroom were only in fair condition. For the price it should have been excellent. Room service food was absolutely HORRIBLE.
This place was recommended by a friend who has stayed here before. I was not disappointed. Clean rooms friendly staff. Hot food and free drinks in evening. Will recommend to others. Hot breakfast in the morning
"Clean, friendly staff, plenty of amenities.

Lots of pillows is always a plus for me, the bedding was comfortable and clean.

The food was good, I thought their chicken wings were outstanding.

I enjoyed my stay and would return."
"I was very satisfied with DT Marietta. the staff is very friendly and courteous. The hot breakfast was excellent, variety of choices. Hotel is close to restaurants, shopping center. Location is great. Rooms and furnishings are excellent top quality."
The ATL Marriott Gateway hotel was comfortable and very conveniently located from the airport.  Angela's customer service in the concierge lounge was fantastic!  I enjoyed staying here and would gladly stay again.
"the good :bed is clean, quiet, comfortable

The bad: property in need of renovation, carpet stained, no counter in bathroom, dark out curtains broken, no answer at the front desk, multiple tries, heat/air difficult to regulate and very few luggage trams"
Wow- appreciate the review Sheila G... the shout out to Alan and Valet Crew is much appreciated.  Look forward to seeing you again in Atlanta.  Cheers- Zach
"Thx. so much for your review, and for being our guest. We apologize you didn't enjoy every aspect of your stay, but we hope you'll come back and stay with us again!"
"We stayed at the Embassy Suites when we helped our son prepare to move. The accommodation was perfect. The staff was friendly and helpful and knowledgeable. Our stay was short, we enjoyed the atmosphere at the Embassy Suites."
"This was an amazing find !
Last minute find with very late checkout but very well featured 
Meets criteria for a Marriott at a much lower average price than expected for that level 
Clean convenient and nice at an easy to reach local"
"#renatlmidtown #businessunusual #renhotels

If you ever have the opportunity to attend their annual Day of Discovery, do yourself a favor and go! Everyone was awesome, great hosts, great food and great company!"
You could miss your turn getting into the hotel. The staff was extremely friendly except for the housekeeper banging on the door at 8:30am. Location was also good and right off the interstate and close to bars and local restaurants.
Checked in 1:49 pm parked brought luggage up to room. Returned to car 30 mins later only to find my lock smashed in and $1100  of camera equip & priceless memories gone. Cust Serv and understanding NOT
It's a pretty nice place don't expect much from breakfast. Perfect for flying out of or into ATL. The pool has a ton of chlorine not recommended for kids who open their eyes under water. Otherwise clean place and friendly staff.
"great location, nice clean room, excellent breakfast, nice, friendly service and everyone we had contact with was very helpful.  Perfect location to go to aquarium and park, easy walk from the MARTA, nice area which felt safe to walk around"
"This was a great hotel for a quick quick getaway weekend. The hotel is located near the airport, restaurants, and interstates. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms for very clean. I will stay again."
"Michael Toles in particular was extremely kind and helpful, giving us recommendations, etc. while driving me and my colleagues on the shuttle. Aside from this, the rooms were excellent and the entire staff welcoming -- from housekeeping to storing my luggage after I checked out."
"Rooms very clean, very quiet area, friendly, really an excellent choice ...the only problem was the parking lot. Not enough spaces for the building. Breakfast was delicious, every morning something different."
"Always again! Great, Friendly and Helpful Staff. Perfect Location. Close to Public transportation. Great Area to walk around. Georgia Tech right across the street.Not to far from local Attractions. Perfect for Couples."
Genuinely enjoyed the service and amenities at the Hotel. The service was first class and the food was excellent. I had problems with the toilet in my room but they were diligent in resolving the problems.
"I was hesitant at first when booking. The price was to good to be true. Our room was nice and clean the staff was nice and pleasant. The breakfast was great. I was really pleased. 
Zattie Keisha Chantel
Were very nice and helpful"
"We stay at this property every time we need an overnight before heading to the Caribbean. It is very convenient to the airport, and the rooms are roomy and comfortable. The staff is very friendly. The restaurant has fantastic French onion soup!"
The hotel is under renovation. we did not get any kind of amenity to compensate the bad state of the lobby and the so call restaurant. They do not announce that it is under renovation. When you get there you are trapped.
We're so very sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your stay with us. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies.
The stay at Embassy was very relaxing. The rooms were clean and very exquisite! Hot tub experience was great as well! We enjoyed having access to the shuttle for shopping and entertainment! I will definitely be back. This is now my Hotel of Choice!
"Great breakfast, by far the best free breakfast I've had associated with a hotel.  Room was good, drinks ok (I missed happy hour). Rooms could use a little attention to detail, but pretty good.  Staff was slow, but polite and efficient."
Nice new chic hotel. I love the fact that there isn't any gross carpet in the rooms. I wish there was more dining options but the restaurant food was good. And room service was very fast. All the staff was very courteous.
"The staff is very friendly, the service was great, the rooms were large and clean.  The complimentary shuttle service was a nice touch!  The valet attendants greated me by name each time i request or returned the car."
"Tim Richards was very courteous and helpful when I needed his assistance. He quickly resolved the issue and offered a complimentary appetizer for my inconvenience. Overall, the staff is wonderful. Thanks Tim."
"Staff seemed more interested in anything but greeting a checking in guest. Indifferent at minimum. 

No bathroom paper on bathroom tissue roll! How does any hotel overlook this detail????

Location is great for my purposes."
"Nice hotel for a weekend getaway. Attentive staff, large rooms, great location. Probably the best hotel i've stayed in in ATL. this was my 2nd stay and was not disappointed. i'll definitely book again."
"Excellent hotel with great staff who worked very well with my entire family who was there for a weekend event!!! Accommodations were excellent and breakfast service was really good. Location of the hotel was really convenient to both shopping, restaurants and things to do."
"From checkin to checkout the service we experienced was top notch.  The rooms were elegantly decorated, including the conference rooms which we booked for my mother's birthday party.  The staff was very quick to accommodate our requests."
"Needs work, has great potential though. The rooms are not quality, but with a little TLC and renovations, this can be achieved. There is a lot of mold and dry wrought. The location is nice and central to downtown and a good walk."
Everything about our stay was handled with EXCELLENCE! The hotel was super crowded but the staff made us feel as if we were the only ones there.  I would highly recommend the Regency Club service if you choose to stay at this Hyatt Regency.
"I was not satisfied with not be able to use the refrigerator, the dust in the room counter in bathroom not clean. I was almost charged over 800 dollars for a room that only should have been 109.00 I was"
Excellent property with a hearty breakfast (this is a paid breakfast of around $10) and comfy beds.  Huge spacious rooms with lots of space for a couple. Very quiet with no issues at all. We will be staying here again!
"upgraded from queen double room (queen beds were small) to King suite. King bed very comfortable .. fold out couch was fine, kids never complained.  pool was a little small, but that's not even complaint. would def stay again"
"Nice, clean, comfy hotel. Staff was pleasant and helpful. The only issue was the wifi internet was very slow and often disconnected. The rooms were clean and nice, but the bath tub was a refinish and I could tell...the finishing was coming off."
Easy check in. Newly remodeled. Staff perfect. Friendly. Clean rooms. New beds. Everything excellent. No complaints. You'll love this place. Centrally located to the areas activities. Easy access off interstate.
"Thx. so much for your comments, and for being our guest. We're so glad you and your wife enjoyed your time with us. Please do come back again!"
"This hotel staff understands how to make their guest feel at home. The front desk staff-Juan, Ryan, Jessica and Taqua, along with the valet attendant-Mike, were amazing. The housekeeping staff is also amazing. This was the best customer experience that I have received in years."
"Very satisfied with the companies decision to have us stay at this hotel. Very good service, nice staff, appropriate amenities.  Hotel is located at a Marta transit stop making travel to and from airport convenient."
"Leaky toilet that kept running all night, the air conditioner was not cooling the room, didn't report this since we got in so late and founf this after we were sleeping. Dissatisfied and disappointed, not again to this one"
You are a VIP and we are happy you chose to stay with us!
"We truly appreciate your comments and are glad to hear you found our team to be helpful and friendly.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon in the near future.

Thanks,"
Rooms are very spacious. We had a king suite which provided plenty of room for our pack n play and stroller. The kitchen was very nice to have in the room. Pool was room and stayed stocked with towels.
"It looks like Homewood bought a very old apartment complex and made into a hotel. Some of the units had outside facing doors making it more of a motel. Bearable, if you didn't think about it too much."
Average and clean hotel on Atlantas north side.  Good showers and friendly staff.  The parking garage is the biggest downside as the card readers don't work well and the spaces are tight.  Room is basic but comfortable.  All of the normal amenities.
"The rooms were wonderful, breakfast was great, and the valet service was a nice touch. The only complaint i have would be the shower head wasnt properly working, very little water pressure. Will definitely stay there again"
Perfect stay to visit or business in Atlanta. Near of Downtown. Well comunicate with train and bus. Very nice and clean. Great staff!!!. you can breakfast at the Hotel and has a Bar inside. A lot of conviniences to do your trip easy.
"Shane was incredible. He made our check-IÃ¢ÂÂm experience and stay even better than we could have possibly hoped for. We will definitely come back, and weÃ¢ÂÂre asking for Shane. We would like him promoted immediately, if possible."
Great customer service and incredible room expereince!  I'm looking for to staying at this particular location again in the very near future.  Guest services and the receptionist made me feel like a king during my 3 night stay.
"Nice property.. An older Peachtree high rise that's been beautifully updated and modernized. Right across from Marta station and within blocks to Hall of Fame, Tabernacle,  and aquarium.  Only downside is parking...valet only. I am a regular when in Atlanta . Terrific staff"
"Everything was lovely.Great room, wonderful bed, great service, wonderful shower and bathroom. There should be free wifi for all guests ( only criticism). Wonderful delicatessen ( Goldberg's) in the adjacent ""Battery Park"" area to go to for breakfast. Wonderful food at great prices."
"Very nice hotel with easy access to I-75. Lots of parking and great interior look and feel.  Staff members were very helpful, and cookies were so good there should be a limit to how many you can have.  Great stay."
"Loved the location, almost stole the luxurious robe:), the receptionists abd all personnel were extremely welcoming, attentive and accommodating, just did not like the elevators with confusing enrries and multiple, never ending stops. Wish that the pool was easier to get to."
"Great deal/great location!  Girls weekend out, had a wonderful experience!  Courtesy car was a Tesla!  Great restaurants within walking distance.  The rollaway was super plush and just as comfy as the king.  Spacious, elegant rooms with marble baths."
Great customer service.  Front desk personnel very professional and kind.  Loranda and Sandra took good care of me during my stay.  Excellent Breakfast with variety.  Was surprised at quality much better than comparable hotels in area.  Thank you to manager Kenyata for your extra help.
The young lady at the front desk was exceptional! There was no parking so she moved her car to let the guest park there. The lobby was full and she still made time to be nice and spend a moment with each guest.
"Stayed just for one night but the hotel was great.  Bed was super comfy and the room was really nice.  Loved the shower!  The location was good, but unfortunately a lot of the restaurants close early on Sunday."
"From the self park lot, to check-in, to getting a cookie, the entire process was very efficient. I arrived late in the day and left early, therefore not utilizing any of the onsite amenities. I would stay at this location again."
The accommodations and customer service were excellent. Loved the outside patio. We used the shuttle for dinner and to go the Braves game. The free breakfast was outstanding including the delicious omelette! Will definitely stay here again.
We apologize for the inconvenience you experienced during your time with us. We will work more efficiently to ensure this is an isolated issue.
As with most of the larger Marriotts you will find this one to be clean and well taken care of.  The plus for them is their employees~very friendly and engaging.  The hotel is fine...but it gets an extra circle for the staff!
"Awesome room. Roomy, clean, with only problem being an unfinished repair of a small hole in bathroom.  Friendly staff at checkin. Breakfast was awesome as well, with great selection and presentation.  Shuttle to airport was great"
"Great location, everything is within a few minutes from here, inside store and bar were great, the  free pool table was great when you just wanted to get away and get a minute alone. And the free wifi was convenient."
"Excellent location in Buckhead.
Very cleaned, and very nice people in all areas.
Shuttle was available almost all the time.
Rooms and salons perfectly accommodated for our purpose!
I recommend this hotel for business and vacations also!!"
"Wanted to get away and chill for the weekend W/OUT kids.  The Club was perfect, EXCELLENT SERVICE, EXCELLENT FOOD AND BEVERAGE SELECTION, EXCELLENT OVERALL EXPERIENCE. My wife and I throroughl enjoyed our ""Down Time"" at The Ritz."
"Excellent location for a business meeting; then, team building at night while watching a game. Super easy access to all the park has to offer, in and out of park. Very enjoyable experience for business and personal time."
"I have been staying here several times a year for 20 years. The location is excellent with the rise of Mid-Town Atlanta, Foxx Theater, Marta, its close to everything but just  away from the downtown hassle. Rooms are large and ideal for extended stays."
This was by far the best service I have had in sometime. Even at checking in the way the young lady Tiffany made us feel welcome we knew it was going to be a great vacation.i definitely recommend crowne plaza midtown
"Professional staff.  The room was nice and clean. Convenient location to my job, but the area was noisy (sirens and street/interstate traffic), and the mattress was too firm which made it hard to sleep comfortably."
"Visited for a conference. Happy with the high speed wifi, restaurants and coffee on sight and in walking distance and the helpful staff. The rooms were average and not swanky or ""grand"" by any means. But a very comfortable experience. Would definitely stay again!"
"Stayed on business trip along with other colleagues.

Quiet, modern room with a comfortable bed.  Good common spaces for group gatherings at the end of the day.  Walking distance to several restaurants.  Bar on sight.  Fast parking attendant service.  Of course, the good cookies!"
"Comfortable, friendly, great service.  Walking distance to a number of places to eat, easy transportation to and from the airport via the MARTA gold or red lines, walking distance to the Georgia Aquarium, Coca Cola world, centennial Olympic park, an many other attractions."
Great experience at this hotel. The staff and level of service is superb. The amenities are amazing. Great location. A little pricey and there was construction going on which prevents this from being a 5 star rating.
"It is just like the photos.  Excellent staffing, hospitality and great buffet.   I would recommend them highly.  I definitely would stay here again.  I am disabled and I received excellent assistance at the buffet."
"This hotel is great! It is clean, new and modern. The staff is friendly. The room was clean. The housekeeper left towels and supplies outside our door in the morning. Breakfast was excellent. We will definitely be staying here again!"
"Do not stay here! Sink clogged, toilet leaked water, tub leaked water, toilet seat not secure, badly needs paint, carpet dirty........front desk staff could care less. Gave zero effort to assist and when we checked in they gave zero directions of amenities."
"Unbelievable service and support ... Azalea Room, Mountain Laurel Room and executive conference rooms are first class. And, food incredibly prepared for our playoff football team!

Thank you Emory Conference Center Hotel"
"We're so glad you enjoyed your room and stay with us! Thx. so much for being our guest. Please come back again, soon!"
"Very nice hotel. Very friendly & helpful staff. Don't care for the $30 mandatory valet, but Uber took care of that! Beds are comfortable, noise level inside was minimal (they can't help the sirens outside, lol) All and all a great stay!"
"Had a wonderful time networking ,
Great food , space,drinks!!
Will always come to dine and socialize..
The roof top space is awesome..firepit great for night time chillin space ...staff is friendly and helpful
 Laran,Sonia thank you"
"My daughter's birthday was very important and this stay was very valuable to me. I really like that she enjoyed her stay with Rose Peddles and Candles from the door to the bed, Champagne and Balloons with her favorite candy Peanut M&M's"
I have been to Atlanta several times before. The room was excellent for the price. It was conveniently located to shopping and transportation. The only drawback was parking at the hotel was expensive.
"Excelent Room and hotel staff Very good. Breakfast was good, deverÃÂ£o options. Cleaning and preparing the Room on a daily basis. I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone who goes to Atlanta. Very good"
"I've been staying at this hotel for the last 4 business trips and I am never disappointed. The hotel is ascetically appealing, the bar downstairs is convenient and they make great drinks. The rooms are nice and cozy and always clean."
WeÃ¢ÂÂre so glad you feel that way about us! Eggs Benedict is a great choice. Hope youÃ¢ÂÂll wine and dine with us again soon!
"Hotel was clean and nice, rooms were very pretty and confortables. Complementary breakfast was awesome, they had omelet live station. Good location, close to the downtown but in a quiet area. We enjoyed our stay."
"Had a wonderful weekend at the Omni, and were wonderfully pampered at the Serenity Spa.  Just one warning- the spa charges a 20% ""hotel service fee"" that is not disclosed in advance and is not labeled on the invoice."
"Hotel grounds were very clean, the staff was friendly, and check in was easy.  Overall enjoyed my stay.  Would definitely go back if in the area again.  Shuttle from the Marta station was quick and easy.  Plenty to do in the area."
"Hotel was beautiful, service excellent, food great, room snacks marked ""treat yourself"" on dresser as you walk in, very expensive...only after I ate them thinking they were complimentary was I informed that I now have a gigantic room balance...not nice"
I came to this location for business. We stayed a week. Customer service was great and they helped me with any and everything. I valet parked my car during my stay and they were fast and efficient. Great stay
"Staff is very nice. They have a shuttle van and complementary breakfast, which were both very helpful to our stay due to a family member being at Emory hospital. Reasonable prices and nice rooms! Sometimes noisey, but it is Atlanta."
This hotel was beautiful....the rooms was above expectations...the restaurant food was amazing and the indoor pool was a plus...will definitely stay again..the staff really took care of us and because its downtown ATL you have to pay to park but OVERALL we enjoyed everything
"I enjoy staying at the Embassy Suites, the staff is very professional and accommodating.  The breakfast and evening reception is OUTSTANDING!!!  The rooms were clean and comfortable and would recommend to others that are on travel for business or pleasure."
Quick review  - more to come later but generally poor service if you have reasonable expectations. I realize Atlanta was struggling with bad weather but the staff was generally not very customer focused and overall I was pretty disappointed with this property.
"Staff is very friendly. The restaurant had good food. They have $1 wine happy hours which are wonderful!

Very conveniently located...right next to the rotating restaurant and less than a mile from GSU."
"Nice location, use if shuttle helpful. Not sure why tipping each time we use the shuttle is required by the drivers, if the shuttle is complimentary. Ruth Chris's restaurant was very good, the food was good"
Excellent experience! The service was great from every member of the staff. The room was beautiful and we had a relaxing night which was all we needed. The location is perfect as well. In walking diatance of anywhere you would want to go.
Enjoyed our stay.  Very convenient for the race and extremely quiet for a downtown hotel - we were on a high floor which helps.  Self park is $25 and valet is $30 so for convenience we did the valet.  Numerous dining options within walking distance.
I stayed there for a work conference and the service was awesome. Topia was our bartender and is amazing! She is super friendly and took care of us the whole time we were there. I will go back just to see her!
"Professional staff, great location, worth the money! Parking was a bit expensive whether you choose self parking or valet parking. Lots of restaurants close by. Check and out process was extremely simple. Online check in available"
"If you are going to an Atlanta Braves game... this is the place to stay! Friendly staff, visually appealing surroundings and comfortable rooms. Not even one complaint. I would recommend for your business or personal trips."
"The hotel is nicely located in the Georgia Tech Campus. It is well-connected to the Marta train with a direct route to the airport. The rooms are spacious and well-maintained, the staff is friendly and helpful."
"Friendly staff, excellent accomodations and easy access to amenities. The suite layout was appartment like, very convienient. I wish all hotels were designed and operated like this one. I would definitely stay here again."
"I am staying with Days Inn 3 days a week and have had a great experience throughout. The staff are courteous and accommodating. The rooms are cleaned with care. The pool is clean and refreshing.  The breakfast bar has really good food, especially the pancakes."
"Stayed here for a few nights while attending a wedding.  Hotel is really beautiful, clean, staff was super friendly.  Enjoyed the restaurants on site.  Within walking distance to shops and area restaurants.  Also easy walk to/from train."
"Arrived Early And The Staff Was Very Attentive To Get Me A Room. The Room Was Very Clean, Housekeeping Came By Every Morning To Replenish Fresh Towels. The Breakfast Was The Best Ever. Totally Great!!"
"Great location off 75,  This location is in walking distance to many restaurants.  All hotel staff I came in contact with were very friendly.  The hotel has cool vibe about the place from the lobby/bar area to the hotel rooms."
Overnight stay to fly out early the following morning.  Excellent stay.  Comfortable beds and pillows.  Front desk staff friendly and helpful.  Very convenient to tram to either rental car or terminal.  Would return to this hotel given the opportunity.
"Enjoyed my stay there! Was passing through and needed a place to stay. Enjoyed the view, valet, and staff. Great Accommodations with great showers! Hot showers and good water pressure. Enjoyed a good nights rest on our journey!"
"Patricia, we're so very sorry to hear that your stay was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies."
"Great location 10 min from downtown, 5 from the airport. The staff at the hotel were great they were all very friendly, and helpful.  Very nice room for the price. The was very clean and well maintained along with the rest of the hotel."
"I enjoyed everything about my stay. Staff were very efficient and friendly. Room was excellent, would make a great apartment or extended stay place. Breakfast was very well cooked and presented. Room location in complex was not great but still great experience."
"This newly renovated hotel is sleek and modern.  The staff was extremely helpful.  The coffee shop and restaurant we're clean, well staffed .  The pool was beautiful.  Wish the weather had cooperated.  Would definitely recommend staying there.  Five stars."
Hotel is a dump. Should not have been open during construction. For the price payed per nite I did not get close to the amenities I paid for. The hotel was outdated in disrepair and extremely dirty. Mildew smell in room
I expected a little bit more from this hotel there was a hole in my bathroom wall which was not repaired all the way shower curtain in the bathroom was too short  which causes a lot of water on the floor
"My husband, daughter and I truly enjoyed staying at this location. Staff was friendly, hotel decorated nicely, many amenities perfect for family and conveniently located next door/walking distance to Cobb Energy Center."
Nice group of people here from front desk to cleaning staff. Hotel is clean and rooms are nice. I try to atay here when down in atlanta for business. Rates vary as with all hotels and at times it doesnt make good sense.
"Not my favorite-- by a long shot-- feels a bit rundown and service is very average.  Nonetheless, location is very very good and rooms are very comfortable-  food is ok, though not fantastic either.  Location can be noisy too so a consideration for light sleepers"
"An excellent and exciting new restaurant has opened inside the hotel . service was excellent, indeed quite extraordinary . 
Our waiter Sergio explained the breakfast menu with a great attitude . 
Definitely recommended, I can't wait to taste the dinner menu ."
"We love to stay at this hotel when visiting Atlanta. We enjoy parking our car and taking MARTA to downtown events. There is no parking fee, free shuttle, and breakfast. We'll be back in September for an other Alabama game!"
"Stayed at Wyndham as hosting hotel for Atlanta Pen Show.
Good facilities.
Had to drive a bit far to go to nicer restaurants."
"Everything about the hotel, staff, location, services, was exemplary. The location was central to the Atlanta Aquarium, the World of Coca-Cola, and the Georgia World Congress Center.  All within walking distance."
"After a long Flight from Europe you want relax and stay nearby the Airport Ã°ÂÂÂ
Because the next day another family member will arrive then.
Good hotel good bed and kindly staff.
Just 3miles away from the Airport and a free shuttle bus ."
"This review is specifically for Alonzo, W Driver.  
Alonzo was extremely professional and available to bring me to my conference.
He also suggested some great restaurants and bars.
He is a great asset to the W."
Had a wonderful room on 17th floor and slept like a dream on that comfortable bed!  Loved the lounge couch to read & watch television.  The room was large enough for family to come to visit.  Turn down service was great!
"The rooms where what i requested, however once you select disabled access room quality changes drastically. Equality is diffidently an issue. Equality is diffidently an issue. Equality is diffidently an issue. Equality is diffidently an issue."
"We apologize for the inconvenience, we strive to make it right.  We truly appreciate your business and hope you visit us again the not too distant future!"
Great Hotel. Excellent Staff. Definitely will return if given the opportunity. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a hilton in Atlanta. Seemed like no request was too big or small. One of the best hotel stays in my recent experience.
"Comfortable, flexible and Easy accessible. I liked the stay at Double tree, i got free breakfast coupons for my first stay and it is easy accessible to my work place. the breakfast was nice and people too"
And u would recommended to anyone . I would stay here again if I was coming into town . Also the shuttle runs every few min so that you are able to travel to the airport without having to pay for a cab
"Great stay for Sweetwater 420 festival! Sat in pool/hot tub and listened to music, ordered Ruth's Chris french fries for late night snack and enjoyed the complimentary breakfast (omelet bar). The happy hour in the evening was a nice touch!"
"Located just steps to the train and a 90-second ride to the Atlanta terminal, perfect! Very comfortable room with a great bed and a TV equipped with Netflix.  Made a stay for the purposes of catching a flight the next morning very enjoyable."
Staff were very friendly and courteous.  Location is great. Room and food are less than average while prices for both are higher than similar providers. Will not stay there again since there are other accommodations. Nineteen more letters needed to accept comment.
I stayed here for a continuing education seminar.  It is easy to find and shielded enough from traffic that it is relatively quite even though it is by a busy road.  The rooms and food are excellent and upscale.
"The American Hotel is a lovely hotel with a long history in the heart of downtown Atlanta. It was a stone's throw from the Tabernacle, and I would definitely stay there again if I attended another concert at that venue."
"Excellent accommodations for price. Rooms were very clean, spacious, and comfortable, with suite setup including table/desk, and refrigerator. The location very convenient for . Staff was courteous and helpful. Would definitely stay again."
Do not like the changes that have been made.  The bar area was beautiful with lots of seating and now there is nothing cozy and comfortable about it.  The rooms are great and the people that work there are wonderful
"InterContinental Buckhead is a great hotel! Outdoor swimming, comfortable rooms and friendly staff. Particularly like to thank Carlos who did a great job answering all my questions and welcoming me. Looking forward to the rest of my stay!"
Stayed here for a conference and enjoyed the week I was there.  Rooms are big and the food was really nice.   Try the mall across the road if you need some food variety.  A bit far from the airport but can recommend nonetheless.
I ordered room service after a very tiring day. Took 3 tries to get room service correct. Placed a breakfast order card on the door for the next day. No one ever picked it up so no breakfast. No sympathy
"There's a hidden self parking lot across the street, next to the courtyard hotel. It's much cheaper and shorter walking distance than the hotel's self parking!! The parking lot is open to the general public."
"we loved the hotel, very clean &    nice   breakfast was very good server was very nice, rooms was very clean every day, the banquet room was just to our liking,the family loved it very  much, we had family from California, Ohio, Minnesota, Chicago, Alabama"
"Stayed at Emory Conference Center Hotel for a weekend.  Quiet, spacious hotel.  Very pleasant staff.  Well appointed rooms. Fine toiletries.   Ideal place to stay when visiting Emory University.  Enterprise Car Rental right on premises."
Would recommend to anyone and love the staff and service. Great location for many events and felt the love. Has a great place to relax and chill in the lounge and a cool pool table to have a drink at!
"I town to visit a relative at Shepherd Center. Shuttle service from hotel to Shepherd was invaluable to me. Manager was visible and helpful, but staff was just as courteous and efficient when manager not there."
"Excellent service beautiful building great service Randi especially, friendly and knowledgeable.  BeyoncÃÂ© is a dog to said thanks for Ellis hotel taker her with the all amenities BeyoncÃÂ© back happy to Florida"
"Alyssa, we're so glad we could be of service with your AC, and that you enjoyed your stay with us, and our Regency Club, which is a great option for b'fast, dinner and snacks! Please do come back and stay with us again!"
"Rooms and staff all are excellent. Evening desk was very helpful. Got an upgrade too. best shower.
Soft goods very high quality. No complaints at all. a small concern that TV programming was lagging between picture and sound and pixelated. Overall, best experience,,,,"
"Pricey when totaling with taxes!! Good location, good service.  Needs some TLC with cleaning, pool water appeared dirty/cloudy. Overall fair place to stay. Breakfast was good, nice dining area.  Plenty of variety to choose from.  Alright for a quick nights stay when passing through"
"The housekeeping staff seems to be severely understaffed. Stayed 4 nights without changed sheets, vacuuming, or bathroom cleaned. They made bed & replaced towels after 6:00 each day. Friendly staff & nice facility but will stay elsewhere next time."
"Very nice midtown hotel. Walking distance to the Fox theatre. From the outside, itÃ¢ÂÂs not much to look at. But once you valet the car an walk inside, this place is pretty awesome. This is one of ATLÃ¢ÂÂs hidden gems."
The staff were extremely friendly and helped me with any questions I had. The cleanliness of my room was above par. I would highly recommend any family/friends to stay their if they ever visit Atlanta.
Spent one night during a road trip. Staff was friendly and professional. Room appeared to have recently been remodeled. Very comfortable and clean. Good shower and comfortable bed.  Very nice breakfast buffet.  Would recommend and would stay again.
We always enjoy our stay at the Hyatt house. The room was nice and clean. The staff is always friendly and the breakfast was good as well. Hyatt House will always be our first choice. I would definitely recommend to family and friends!
"Fantastic experience after leaving a horrible hotel in Marietta. Pool was the best, brunch delicious & staff was perfect. We had adjoining rooms, a free drink from the bar & immaculate beds. Definitely look forward to staying again."
"Landed at 11:30pm and the shuttle never came to pick us up so we had another hotel shuttle drop us off. Room smelt like weed, 1 elevator was broken, chocolate stain on curtain, and terrible service from the front desk."
"Great check in experience - quick, personal and pleasant.  Great room upgraded to executive suite - thank you - really appreciate the walk-in shower!  Nice bar for a drink after dinner.  Enjoyed the service."
"Large comfortable rooms, large & modern lobby, small check in area. Starbucks in the lobby. Staff were nice and accommodating. No issues, pleasant stay for a couple of nights, a little outside of downtown. Large atrium style, needs some updating, but does not affect quality."
"Great service, kind staff, and great amenities. We wish there was a hot tub or jacuzzi, but the indoor and outdoor pools were very nice! The management accommodated our family when we exceeded who was confirmed as coming! The food was great!"
"Not a bad price for a decent hotel.  Good location, but parking is either expensive or a bit of a walk with luggage.  Didn't eat at restaurant but looked over menu.  It was a bit expensive for a moderately priced hotel."
Had a great time here and the location is excellent for walking to many great dining places.   I would recommend this hotel.  Only negative experience was requesting a luggage cart at checkout that never arrived.
"This is my go to place when I plan a night out in Atlanta. Close enough to everything for a cheap Uber. Clean rooms, friendly staff and free breakfast is decent."
Excellent staff who became family when family couldn't be there. Everyone went above and beyond to help my daughter and I during a medical challenge. Chosen due to closeness to CHOA (Children's Healthcare of Atlanta)
Place was clean.  Staff was very friendly & helpful.  Nice location in the Battery as it was close to everything.  Only negative was the bars did not open until 4.  Pool was nice.  Food was good.  Would stay here again.
If you stay at this facility know that there is a $16 per day parking fee in addition to your nightly rate. We didn't know this until we checked in. We were told it was because it's located near the airport.
"We booked this hotel last-minute, and it worked out well.  The staff were very friendly, the free breakfast was good, and the rooms were comfortable, clean, and nicely sized.  We would definitely stay here again."
The shuttle service is a nice plus. The breakfast was better than the typical free breakfast. The room was clean and bed comfortable. You are paying for the location...Not amenities.   Several good restaurants within walking distance. Parking onsite too.
"The Team will be so excited to read your amazing review. And the best compliment you can ever pay us is to return for another visit, we can't wait for yours."
"Hotel was nice, didnÃ¢ÂÂt spend much time there. However, the suite we had had poor lighting and the fridge didnÃ¢ÂÂt work. Was disappointed with this. Also the WiFi was down initially but was working again with that hour."
"Was great location but parking cost was a bit of a premium. The room was fantastic and the breakfast was perfect.  Also enjoyed a quick check-in.  The printer did not work to print out boarding passes, but the trip was great."
I was very impressed I loved staying here. I was there for business but the customer service was incredible. I loved the food the room was clean and the meeting room was gorgeous. I felt right at home
"This hotel is one of my favorite airport Marriott options.  Very clean, fresh amenities and easy access to airport and rental car center.  Nice health club, loyalty lounge and restaurants.  Consistently a great stay for needs that require proximity to airport."
Enjoyed the convenience this hotel afforded me to the training class I went there for. The evening social was fantastic. The room was very clean and well maintained and the staff were all friendly and accommodating. Would definitely stay there again.
Hotel staff went out of their way to help.  Hotel is centrally located easy to get to train from hotel to airport.  Very nice rooms. Hotel has a great breakfast send U.S. across the street from a good little Italian restaurant
"Great place except bar is very expensive and drinks are meager. The services are top notch, the health club is minimal and club very nice, clean locker room, fab pool....nice restaurants and room service.....BUT THE DRINKS ARE VERY SKIMPY!"
"Rooms were filthy. Housekeeping clearly doesn't know how to dust or clean. Empty bottlecaps from previous guests on windowsill, dirty bathrooms, hair from previous guest on bedsheets. I couldnt wait to check out!!"
"Hotel was new, the rooms generous, clean and quiet, all for a very reasonable price for downtown Atlanta.  Staff was pleasant.  Breakfast was not bad (slightly better than average). I will stay again if business takes me back to that part of Atlanta."
We're so glad you enjoyed your time with us! We'll let Sonya and the team know you enjoyed your omelette! Hope you can stay with us again the next time you're in town!
"Great lace to stay, welcomed by the staff who could not do enough, when they found out it was our honeymoon the quickly got us roses, choccies and bottle of wine. Sufficient breakfast and good rooms really enjoyed our stay and would use it again."
I wish the internet was totally free but to just browse mobile is pretty decent.  Pay attention when the front desk staff tells you how to get to the hotel parking in the parking deck as it can be really confusing down there.
"Great View, Clean and Friendly StaffGreat Location - walking distance for all our activities downtown.Nice surroundings. Loved the ambiance of the hotel. Very modern and impressive Will definitely book again."
"We have always stayed here when flying out early the following day. The staff are friendly, rooms are always clean and comfortable and it's close enough to be able to grab a few extra winks. I highly recommend!"
"Great location. Very convenient to mall and restaurants. The room was clean. Tim, the front desk agent provided the best customer service ever. He greeted every guests with a smile and personality plus. Of course, the cookies were amazing."
"Ok hotel for a budget conscious traveler.  Quaint older building, but needs renovation. Staff is super friendly and has world class customer service. Very convenient to the Marta and downtown restaurants."
This hotel was very nice and the price was reasonable. The room was clean and very comfortable. The breakfast was very good too. I would definitely stay here again. The location was convenient to the mall and many downtown activities.
Stayed at the Marquis during Music Midtown. A bit of a distance if you want to walk to Piedmont Park (which we did) but the hotel was very nice with plenty of amenities and a very nice and under used pool. Definitely recommend!!
"This place is old, smelly and all around disgusting...neither the ac nor the tv worked..it should be closed down by the health department! You may as well stay at a Motel 6...the restaurant was awesome"
Charge me for the same room 5 times. Said they had fix but of any problems occurred to call office. They will not answer the phone or email. Put me on hold for an hour and still have not returned my call.
"We came to Atlanta to visit family and picked this hotel due to it's proximity to our family. Beautiful hotel, great staff. We were upgraded to a king room (room 504) and had a very pleasant experience. We would definitely stay there again."
"Mike T at the buckhead was great.. he made us feel very welcomed from the beginning to the end. He made sure that we was as comfortable..Thank you thank you and thank you
Shout out Mike T. At the front desk"
We look forward to welcoming you back!
"Great location - quiet.  Staff service is average at best.  Ac did not work well, tub was dirty, and plug did not work.  Water came out brown. Renovated hotel.  Has nice lobby.  Pool had something floating on top of water so didn't go swimming."
I much prefer to stay at Hyatt Place over large conference hotels! It was a much more comfortable and friendly atmosphere than my work colleagues had at a large conference hotel. I felt at home with their hospitality! Thank you Hyatt Place!!!
"What a great review, A8092IOmichaels?  Thank you so much.  We will continue to work hard to make improvements that will push your next visit score to a 5.  Thank you again for staying.  Safe travels, and we hope to see you again soon."
"Clean nice rooms, helpful staff, good location. Beautiful courtyard, nice bar. Quiet. Walking distance to Midtown restaurants. Mini bar in the fridge. Pet friendly and check out time at noon. Didn't get to try the breakfast, as it was too early."
Good value hotel. It is convenient to Suntrust Park. Hotel and staff were nice. Breakfast was good. The shuttle will take you to the ballpark but the wait isnÃ¢ÂÂt worth it because itÃ¢ÂÂs just less than a mile to walk.
"Wonderful stay all the time just wish they have more meat options for breakfast everybody doesn't eat pork. , every time I stay there they always have bacon or some type of pork product, I am not allergic but it's against my religion"
"I prefer Embassy because bed comfortable, Happy hour 5:30 to 7:30 is great, free wine, beer and drinks, we always tip $1 a drink, breakfast is nice and there is a omelette station. Facility nicely decorated."
We loved the view of the city from the 32nd floor but it was sweltering in our room. Restaurant (sports bar) was decent but expensive which we expected. Inside needs some updating but overall a decent stay.
"Near the Marta, right next to the Lennox shopping center which is one of the best anywhere, very high scale, has pool inside, sun deck, very comfortable beds, friendly staff, don't need a car, Lennox shopping center is short walk"
The hotel was very clean and modern -- rooms were comfortable. Absolutely no complaints! We were here for a pen show so it was really nice staying at the same location. There is plenty to do around the area -- would definitely stay here again!
"Great location, value, and staff. Definitely will be back. Beautiful hotel. Close to all restaurants and bars. Staff is very friendly and helpful. I have been here many times and it is amazing every time."
"Even with several conventions going on,  the staff made me and my family feel just as welcome. Great facility, very modern.  Gorgeous room and beds that you never  want to leave.  Omelette station was great as well. Definitely worth revisiting!"
"Very conveniently located for a lay over long enough for a good sleep and breakfast.

Fixtures are a little dated but clean enough for me to rest comfortably. Biggest pleasant surprise of all is they very friendly and helpful staff. Southern hospitality at its best!"
"Excellent hotel, all staff were friendly and helpful. I found the whole Omni experience to be enjoyable. This was my first stay at an Omni property. I would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone for business or pleasure."
Short walk to Marta and a shuttle is available. Breakfast buffet was good. Room very clean. Decent fitness room. Bar closes at 11:00? That makes no sense. Staff was very friendly especially the restaurant staff. Overall a good stay.
"If you have an ATL transfer, this is your best choice. We truly enjoyed the hotel. Good bedding, nothing special but completely decent. I would not stay here for a couple of days but for a day it is fine."
"We truly enjoyed your comments are so happy to hear that you and your family enjoyed your stay with us.  We hope to have you stay with us again soon during your next visit to the area.

Thank You,"
"Hotel is nice, rooms are nice, breakfast is a bit pricey. Not a bad location. Several restaurants within walking distance... plus a Starbucks.  Room rates seemed a bit high.  Bar and Restaurant on site.  Food is good but also pricey."
The staff at this hotel went above and beyond what I expected!! They were very polite and professional. They truly made me feel at home!! Everything about the King Suite was great. The view was beautiful!!
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. It was a perfect place and location for me. 

The staff were IMMENSELY cordial and helpful. The place has this welcoming warmth and niceties that are so attractive and restful for anyone seeking peace and tranquility.."
"Stayed there for only one night, but the place is worth the trip back and forth to the airport.

Location is very good and central. Hotel is very good and clean and wisely priced.

Will sure stay there again."
"Decent location, but there are better in downtown.  Really weird layout of hotel, like they have remodeled and forced a square peg in a round hole. Rooms were average.  Bed was nice.  Nothing special and wouldn't rush back."
Marcus at the front Desk was amazing!  The staff was very accommodating.  Rooms were run down but the friendliness of everyone around and location were great.
"The first two days i didn't have wifi signal.
Location is so so.
The cleaning lady throw all the bottles of water i left inside during their daily cleaning.
I would definitely not consider it again. Sorry."
"Very disappointing. Poor valet service, non working HVAC and ants. Could not figure out how to fix HVAC. Ants got into our luggage. They have great location for event center on roof and I guess feel people will stay there regardless of issues"
Super location with easy access to the Atlanta Airport and surrounding highways.  The newly remodelled hotel features nicely accomodated furnishings and very comfortable beds! The complimentary breakfast and evening reception is a must to enjoy to start and finish your day!
The bar is absolutely fantastic. Brian from Columbia was cool as hell. All the bartenders were actually. My coworker and I had a great stay and great accommodations. The drinks are a little expensive but worth the value.
Beautiful hotel.  And top level service.  From the doorman to the in room dining to the front desk and concierge.  They make you stay feel welcome and special.  And the BEST burger I've ever had for in room dining.
"Even for an airport hotel this one will disappoint you. The service is laughable, it seems they go out of their way to make your stay a miserable experience. Avoid the restaurants if you can you will surly be disappointed"
"Hotel which is close to the airport with great wifi and free breakfast. Great for 1-2 night stop over, but too far for any kind of sightseeing. I found front desk and staff to generally be helpful and supportive."
Hotel is easy walking distance to conference center and other local attractions.  Being next to the Olympic Park is very nice for a stroll in the morning or evening.  Staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly.
"Clean, quiet, great floor plan, gracious staff.  Convenient to airport makes it a great fly-in-fly-out business option.  Staff generally worked to overcome very minor glitches in the experience.  Overall experience was very positive."
We went to Suntrust park for a concert. This hotel was a 5 minute uber drive away. Very convenient and quiet. Good price compared to the hotels that are right by Suntrust Park. Would definitely stay here again. Very clean.
"great hotel.  Super service and outstanding gym, we stayed for a weekend and had a great time.  Great location near midtown and Piedmont Park. We went to a wedding which was unbelievable.  i hope to return soon."
"I had a great time with my friend. We rented to rooms. I wish the hotel could have joining rooms. My friend and I really enjoyed the time in Atlanta. I was a great hotel, with good location. Thank you!"
"I have stayed in a lot of Hotels but Hyatt Place is by far the best. This Airport North location did nothing but solidify that opinion. Close to airport, dining, sports events etc.  I look for a Hyatt Place everywhere I go"
This place is huge and has shopping and restaurants in the hotel. The conference area is very large and can handle a large event. The place was impressive. Had a great conference here. The meeting rooms were numerous and well laid out.
Thais was an excellent experience.  Amazing service from the minute I walked through the door.....it was good to see familiar faces from my visit three years ago.  That speaks volumes for the hotel if the employees are still here from 3 years ago.
Staff was great and the room was clean. I was a little taken back by the breakfast because I assumed it was free. Nothing I was too concerned with. Overall a great stay.
"Great, clean hotel. Staff is very friendly and goes above and beyond to make sure you're happy. We were very satisfied. Kids loved the indoor/outdoor pool. Would definitely stay here again if returned to Atlanta."
"Hotel bed was great!  Room nice size and clean, great bath/shower.   Staff at bar was very nice.  Room service food good.  Food at the conference really good.  'Made special accommodations for us as we are vegans."
"This hotel has a nice work out center, decent rooms with  nice beds.  It was reserved for us for a fan club event and we typically donÃ¢ÂÂt stay at courtyard hotels.  It was a great price and good location."
"Deon, Manager on Site, was extremely accommodating and friendly! We appreciate the great service and the room was phenomenal! We will definitely be back again! The price was very affordable and you can't beat the location in the heart of Atlanta."
Hope to see you back with us soon!
"we liked this hotel, because it was something different. ItÃÂ´s a nice old building .We (4 people) shared two  bedroom (2 queen size beds) and it was okay for us. The room was clean an we had enough space."
"dont eat in the restaurants unless you want overpriced,poor quality food served by unpleasant servers.this was not an isolated experience but the poor attitude was shared by the entire restaurant staff in all 3 locales within the hotel."
"Checked into hotel with no reservation and no problem junior suite was great. Clean well decorated and bright, bathroom large with two sinks large bath and big shower. Breakfast was excellent and service polite and not ott am returning on last night of vacation."
We had our FAMILY REUNION here on the fourth of July this weekend which was extremely busy. Even though the traffic was heavy our stay here was awesome. We were able to watch the fireworks at Centennial Olympic Park from the hotel
Stephanie the sales manager was great host and so was the rest of the staff. Was super helpful with any request our group had to the best of their ability! Shuttle service was handy for any close by running around.
Nice property great people really enjoyed my stay.  Close to the Georgia World Congress Center Great restaurants nearby. Expensive but worth it.   I would defiantly stay there again.  I epically liked the staff
"This was our third trip to the Intercontinental at Buckhead. We love the amenities, friendly staff and central location. My husband loves the breakfast buffet served each morning in the restaurant and I Love the hotel gym and spa services."
I enjoyed my stay at this location due to excellent customer service provided by Mr. Tim Richardson. He was very professional and courteous and ensured our issues were addressed in a timely manner. I would visit this hotel again in the future.
"I would highly recommend to family, friends and clients as a awesome place to stay.  Easy access to MARTA train station which makes getting to and from the airport a breeze!  Great Staff, always there to help you."
Me and my family really enjoyed our stay the breakfast was wonderful the pool and hot tub everything perfect the front desk was great especially ms Patricia she was helpful to we really appreciated her help
Don't pay more for the higher floor---you'll be doing a disservice to yourself by waiting FOREVER on the elevator. Pros were free parking in the deck (if any were available) and decent breakfast in the morning.
"At least the restaurant staff was good. Thank you Dani and Daniel for your paramount service. These two cocktail marvericks are going places baby!!! If I ever have kids, I hope they are as crackjack as them. 

Also, I hope the elevators got fixed."
"As with previous years, we have enjoy staying at the Westin Peachtree Plaza during Dragon*Con; inside cafe/bar, Starbucks, tunnels to the AmeriMark buildings, and express elevators make it a vary pleasurable experience."
Great location for Braves game.  Best welcome cookies in the industry. Clean rooms. Just wish rooms had microwaves.  Bartender in sports grill makes awesome mixed drinks.  Staff friendly. Fast valet parking.
Being an HHonor member I was given a room in second floor in front of the administration office and next to the gym and vending. Breakfast too expensive for the quality. They try to charge me two full breakfast.
"The water main broke in the area.  Hotel staff did not communicate this to the guest.  The Assistant Manager ""text"" staff to them know during a crisis that she would not be in until later that day.  Once she"
I had a wonderful experience! I will return!! The room was exellexce. I could have use a few more towels. The staff was friendly and helpful. I went to a event that was in the lower level of the hotel and had a blast!
"Would recommend for any stay but our wedding here was AMAZING! BEST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD!!
THE FOOD IS AMAZING! The Valet team members helped beyond measure! My wedding specialist Jenelle Burney will take care of you!"
"We're so glad our team could be of service during your stay with us. Thx. so much for being our guest. Please come back and stay with us again, soon!"
"Beautiful hotels and rooms. View was Amazing but unfortunately the 1st floor pool was closed. Not a very big drink selection but it was complimentary so i didn't expect much.  Overall experience was fantastic, you deserve more than 5 stars!"
Generally a clean and tidy hotel with good freindly service.  Good value for money.  Complimentary wifi but a bit slow.  Best pancakes in USA. Nice soft beds and reasonably good tv chanel selection.  Courtesy vehicle for drop offs to local sites
"This facility needs to been renovated.
My room smelled of mildew and bathroom had lot of mold in and out of shower.  

Diamond members only get continental and not full breakfast.

Staff was friendly both front desk and restaurant."
Great experience.  Last minute plans and they were very accommodating.  Awesome customer service.  Quick for requests and informational about how and where to get what I needed or wanted for travel to the local festivities.
"Modern type decor (similar to staying at a Hotel Indigo), scenic pool deck on the 16th floor and central to CNN center, centennial park, aquarium and lot's more!  The front desk was gracious and extended both an early check-in and late check-out."
Positive experience. Great stay. Staff was nice. Parking lot attendant were courteous and considerate. Room was nice and ean. Bed was very comfortable. Would definitely  stay here again. Would definitely recommend this hotel.
"Loved my experience at the Hyatt From the moment I walked in until the day I left. Friendly staff and the food in both the restaurant and the bar was outstanding. Very quaint room with fabulous views of downtown, walking distance to everything."
"We went for dinner, loved the food (recommend the lamb chops) and the entertainment was just what we needed.  Music with a melody and trained musicians who knew any song you requested.  All in all, a romantic evening with charm not usually seen today."
"We typically stay here when we're in Atlanta for business. The rooms are comfortable and clean and the location is close to our client. However, this will not be the place for you if you're looking to walk to restaurants and local attractions."
"The location is great & the staff were very positive & helpful. I was there for a short conference & it was run very smoothly. The room was nice, the area was quiet after 10pm & there are lots of nice restaurants within walking distance."
"I was there for a meeting that lasted 3 days. The rooms were comfortable, and clean. The meeting facilities were comfortable. I did not go by the pool of the hotel, or go around the grounds, since it was pretty cold."
We decided to stay overnight after a show at the Fox Theater.  It is a nice hotel with great room views.  We liked the location and enjoyed the hotel restaurant.  The hotel staff was very friendly and engaged.
"The Grand Hyatt/Buckhead is awesome!  We stayed for 4 nights for my son's wedding and had a King Suite.  Everything about the hotel is wonderful.  Great service, close to restaurants to walk for dinner, great work out room and pool."
I stayed at the Wyndham this past weekend with friends and our experience was awesome. Terry was a great help from helping us find great restaurants and bar/clubs. We went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great time. Thank you Terry.
"Outstanding service, clean and comfortable rooms, and all the amenities and services you would normally expect from a first class organization. The staff makes a great difference: they are all smiles, listen attentively, and provide the answers you want."
Our stay from beginning to end was excellent.  We were welcomed by hotel staff who made us feel like more than just a number. Our room was very clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!
"The staff, room, and food were excellent.  The shuttle was very nice and available as needed.  Great place to stay!"
"we stayed this hotel for two nights.
Hotel staff is average. 
bed is comfortable.
I can hear everything from outside of the street and above our room even somebody just walking in their room because room floor is hardwood floor and very thin wall."
Rates are very friendly and affordable. Rooms are very well maintained. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Missed breakfast so I can't comment on the food..... Even the elevator was clean and had a pleasant scent to it.
very good hotel with affordable price the breakfast was good and have alot of varities the staff was friendly polite and nice the room was good and clean the ac was a bit noisy but it worth coming back again
"Excellent customer service and facilities.  The hotel was undergoing some renovations, but everyone was so welcoming that it didn't matter.  Great room confort, excellent and very accommodating staff.  Plus the added bonus of those outstanding cookies!"
"Located in convenient location downtown Atlanta, GA. Hotel staff were polite and accommodating, room was very clean and modern. Did not experience dining however the lounge was an enjoyable environment."
"great experience, friendly staff, good food and loved the contemporary decor throughout and walk in shower. Would like to have a selection of fresh fruit cups etc in the Market for evenings when you just want something light. Will return in the future for sure!!!"
Enjoyed my stay and the staff was extremely accommodating. I'd definitely stay here again and again. I was here on business and found the location to be perfect in proximity to my client office on Windy Ridge Rd.
The staff was helpful and friendly.  The business center easily accessible.  The hotel was very clean!  Wi-Fi was excellent!  The lobby area was quite relaxing!  The van service made this a very good reason for selecting this hotel and this location.
"I stayed at this hotel twice, both times were pleasant. The staffs were very helpful to accommodate my needs and the room was neat & clean."
"Truly enjoyed our stay here. Came up for overnight celebration for my mom birthday and everyone enjoyed their stay. Staff was amazing, room was very nice and view was awesome. Definitely stay here again when visiting the city."
We're so very sorry to hear that your stay with us was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlgh@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies.
Exceptional service and breakfast. The evening adult snack time was excellent. Great location with very friendly and helpful staff anytime you saw an employee. Clean room and bathroom with plenty of hot water.
Four Seasons is a beautiful HÃÂ³tel with excellent service. Beds are comfortable and the room was very tastefully decorated. Hair dryer didn't work well.  I would stay here again--a good value for the rooms and service.
Helpful and friendly staff.  Pleasure trip and great location in walking distance to sites in downtown area. Lots of eating options nearby and at attached CNN Center.  Only downside is the Atlanta traffic downtown.
"Really enjoyed my stay. Check in took less than 3 min. Room was perfect. At breakfast, my server went out of his way to find me outlet to plug my computer while doing work at breakfast. Valet great too. Will definitely stay again."
Awesome service even at 2 in the morning. The staff was helpful when we arrived that day and extremely helpful when we walked in at 2 in the morning and we needed to park the car. The rooms around were quite.
Beds are most comfortable. Customer service over the phone was horrible. Not one person gave information about new daily charge not required deposit. Still waiting on phone call from hotel about merchandise left behind.
A very clean hotel downtown.  It has a great breakfast buffet and a great staff. Any question was asked to the front desk was answer quickly and very friendly.  We probably could have lived on the French Toast.
We called and asked twice for someone to clean the shower. This is what we came back and saw. I can't believe the shower has black mold all over it. Gross. Otherwise the hotel is what you would expect.
Very nice service staff. I always feel welcome. The hotel has a great location and the food quality is the best around.
Staff were wonderful. Rooms are very clean and comfortable.  The rooms are well appointed.  I enjoyed dinner in the hotel my first evening.  The food was served quickly and was both hot and very good.  All the staff truly cared about making our stay great.
I really enjoyed the hospitality of this hotel. Especially Toya she has excellent customer service and couldnÃ¢ÂÂt ask for anyone better to assist me on booking my room and my stay was awesome!!! Shout out to Toya at The Renaissance Atlanta Midtown Hotel!!
"Modern, adaptive facility prepared for influx of students and parents, yet close to the business heart of Midtown Atlanta. Dining in was delicious with appropriate options. I was really impressed with the room itself."
"Location, location, location!!!  Convenient to the airport. Rooms were clean but double beds a little on the small side with 2 people sharing. Great breakfast. Enjoyable short stay. Friendly courteous staff."
"I have never been treated so cordially than at this hotel! Every single staff member was very friendly, professional and helpful. The food and coffee in the restaurant was fabulous. I would highly recommend this Marriott and would love to stay here again!!"
They renovations are in progress but what is completed looks high class! Can't wait to see the finished project! Definitely will stay there again. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Each room is a two room suite and they look exquisite.
It's an older hotel but is in a really good location. Short travel distance for Atlanta Braves games. Kids had a blast.  Great restaurants nearby. Enjoyed dinner in the hotel restaurant great burgers.  Cookies were warm and awesome as always
This hotel is nicely appointed with terrific service and good food options.  Bed was extremely comfortable and noise was minimal.  The hotel is very well maintained and the peach jelly beans in the lobby are a nice touch.  Will be back when in Atlanta!
We really enjoyed our stay. Our room was ready upon arrival at noon. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The room was clean and the bathroom was very clean. The location was very desirable. I would definitely return to stay here again.
The staff of the Ritz Carlton Buckhead are always personable and extremely friendly. I appreciate their professionalism. I always feel like a valuable consumer at the Ritz Carlton Buckhead. My family and I love this hotel.
"Stayed here recently. It is in a really great part of Buckhead, walking distance to restaurants, grocery, even the Lenox mall is within walking. Room was nicely decorated, clean, and the hotel was a good choice."
"Room was clean. Receptionist was friendly. Food was good. I would recommend this hotel. I stayed here earlier this year and I will stay again when passing through it for just a nice, quick getaway. Loved it!"
"Leila from LA is special. Hard working student and still full of energy at an 11pm check-in. Very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. The American Hotel has a real charming winner in Leila. Keep up the good work, young lady."
"We are glad that you enjoyed your recent stay with us and appreciate your comments.  We look forward to having you stay with us during your next visit.

Thanks,"
"Had our daughter's wedding there and it was wonderful.  The coordinator and staff were top notch and the rooms, food, and everything was great.  The rooms were comfortable, clean and nicely decorated.  IT was easy to maneuver around."
"Stay at this hotel when visiting Emory. Staff is amazing and always so pleasant and friendly. Mr. Watson is the best! Entire staff fabulous. Valet parkers, room service and front desk. Emory Pointe shopping center so close and nice to walk for coffee in morning."
The property is new and well maintained. The staff was outstanding from valet parking to check in. Request a room facing the baseball field. You can't beat the view.   I'll definitely stay here next time I travel to Atlanta
Maintaining our facility and standards will always be a priority!  In fact we are finishing up a meeting room renovation next week!  Hope to see you back very soon!
"This is an older property that has been well-maintained and consistently upgraded over the years.  My suite was beautiful, comfortable, relaxing and spacious.  However, Housekeeping will make sure you leave on time though!!!"
the rooms are very dirty and not maintained properly. The only good thing were the conference rooms. The bar is okay and the food served was okay. The service was lack luster and there was few attempts to resolve issues.
Enjoyed our stay in Atlanta. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Shuttle was convenient and friendly. Restroom was too tiny but breakfast was good. Would stay here again. We enjoyed the location and were able to walk to most places.
"We stayed in this hotel for 3 days. 
Pros: conveniently located to attractions and restaurants, in beautiful pool, clean rooms, reasonably priced for downtown accomodations. 
Cons: Parking fee. Undergoing renovations, ok service."
"This is a typical South American hotel located in Atlanta Georgia. Excellent location, just next door from Emory University Hospital. Very professional staff. Clean and safe. Big rooms, adequate furnishings. Fair prices. Nice music at the lobby, free wi fi for guests."
"Clean room and well appointed. However, bathroom had issues. Sink drain was badly rusted, shower piping was loose from wall and toilet so loose I felt like I was on the Disneyland teacup ride. Very comfortable beds."
The room was quite and comfortable with great staff. The morning breakfast was better than most and this will be my hotel of choice for further visits to Atlanta
"Welcomed by Great staff"" jasmine'  room is nice clean and quiet. Convenient location. Hotel sits off the road a little away from interstate and highway noise. This was my 2nd stay here, will stay here again!"
View of Park room is desirable. Valet only too high and disorganized. Housekeeping not consistent or up to Embassy level. Starbucks in lobby. Many attractions within walking distance. Evening social is great if not too crowded.
Wow...excellent and wonderful are two words we love to hear when describing your experience for your first stay with us!! We do hope you get the opportunity to stay with us again.
hank you for this wonderful review. Please accept our sincerest apology regarding the challenge you experienced during your stay. As we strive to continue to improve our guest service striving for perfection we have shared your experience with our entire team.
"I had a wonderful stay,  everything I needed was available, and didnt have to ask. Just wanted a fridge but didnt want to pay extra. Other than that it was a great stay. Great location, was luxury style, big, offered an exercise room."
furniture in living room worn.  garbage never emptied from previous stay. sheets on bed stained and hair. food for the breakfast removed before the end time for breakfast. no maintenance on duty at night for things like the safe freezing and you cannot open it.
"Superb customer service at check in, notably the front desk manager. Rooms are well maintained and spacious. Room service excellent. Food court in proximity of the hotel, excellent. I would definitely stay here again."
We are glad you appreciated our efforts to be sure our guests have a good stay while we are doing the renovations. Thank you. We hope to see you again in the near future.
"Life is great when you can spend it with family, relaxing and enjoying each others company."
Nice property. Centrally located. Upgrades to rooms nicely done. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Would recommend property to persons visiting Atlanta area and want to be close to downtown. Great!
"Great location, wonderful view. Easy to find with GPS.  Booked online. Courtesous staff, very willing to help with directions and information. Quiet room in North building, valet parking and bellmen service."
"I loved this hotel and the location! We arrived very late but the staff was very nice and I felt welcomed. Hotel is HUGE. I wish we could've stayed for longer, will definitely be coming back here for next time!"
Great service--among the most attentive staff at any hotel I have visited. Superior catering staff who made you feel welcome and genuinely expressed they were there to make the experience pleasant. Clearly a hotel for a pleasant stay. Great location next to high end shopping.
"I stayed here from March through May, during the week, for 3 mos. The staff couldn't have been more courteous. It became my home away from home. The GM was more than accommodating."
Stayed here with my fiancÃÂ© and my sister stayed in another room with her boyfriend. Great location and price. Wonderful customer service. Close to a lot of great places to eat. We had fun. I would recommend this place.
This Hyatt has location going for it. It needs a makeover. Our room and hall had a mildew smell. The buffet breakfast was fair.  Great front desk and shuttle to take you to the main tourist attractions
No complaints. Remodeled and very clean. Across the street from Cumberland Mall and convenient to Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center. Reasonable pricing. Felt very safe. Plenty of parking although underground garage spaces are tight. Would stay again.
"The bedding is very comfortable and luxurious, top of the line. The people who work their are very polite and helpful. Would recommend and would stay again. The location is good. The place is huge and accommodating."
"Staff was very courteous and professional.  I had error from my online reservation that scheduled my stay on the wrong days as well as the correct days.  The front desk clerk resolved the issue immediately and my room was clean, quite, and comfortable."
"Whenever I am in Atlanta, I will always stay at this location due to the outstanding customer experience. The staff here are top-notch and they go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay in Atlanta."
I love this hotel! Everything you need in one place. Convenient to many ATL locations. I have been staying here for business and pleasure. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone! The space and view is simply amazing!
This Marriott has a nice little boutique feel. Beautiful lobby and bar. Lovely service. Champions restaurant is decent. I will definitely stay here again. The Urban Foodie restaurant is in walking distance. Yum!
"We stay here every time we fly out of Atlanta.  Staff is always friendly, convenient to the airport, offers airport shuttle to and from. Breakfast is good and hot and affordable without that ""I need a shower"" feeling at checkout."
"Clean room, wonderful view from balcony.  Every member of staff made us feel welcome.  Will be back next year.  Hyatt Regency Atlanta offers a classic hotel stay in a well-maintained and run hotel.  Classic Southern Hospitality in Downtown Atlanta!!"
"Piss poor service - unprofessional staff - received a notice at 6:20pm for a 3:00 check in - overcharged my credit card
Do yourself a favor a stay somewhere else
Too bad because it is a nice area - hard to find good people"
At checkin advised they were overbooked. Although IÃ¢ÂÂd already checked in online. One night was accused of noise when there was no noise. Food bar had hair in eggs and wasnÃ¢ÂÂt removed. Room was very clean.
"Great location in downtown Atlanta for business or fun. Rooms are nice size and beds comfy. Close to all downtown attractions like Georgia Aquarium, Centennial Park, Phillips Arena, CNN. I parked my car and walked everywhere or easily took Marta if needed."
"Checked in for my 10 year old daughter's birthday so she and her BFF could swim indoors. Staff was great - room was great. We ordered room service for them - that was great. Will definitely go back again,"
"out dated very large hotel noisy at nights a sixtieths building  and elevators poor service  staff not service oriented mattresses need to be replaced last year good gym though and location adequate for convention center and aquarium etc,"
"I have stayed in hotels all over the world and the Mandarin Oriental Atlanta rates as among the best.  Beautiful setting, attentive staff, wonderful food, and just an overall charming southern experience. I highly recommend the Mandarin Oriental Atlanta."
"A W Hotels, our brand image is about what is bold; what is new and next. With design, comfort and style we think you're going to feel right at home."
"This is my hotel of choice.  Even though renovations were taking place, my stay was enjoyable.  I an awaiting my return to see the renovated lobby.  The breakfast buffet was excellent. The location is easily accessible to all interstate."
"Stayed at the Ritz Atlanta for the weekend while in town to see Hamilton.  Excellent accommodations and pure Ritz service from each and every team member.  

Ask for the Red Phone Booth VIP access number.  It is a speakeasy nearby and a great experience."
"Simple, straight forward, well located. Service is good, the look is modern, and location in downtown near everything is great. You can walk to Peachstreet, CNN, Omni and the Park easily. Price is good as well."
"We had a fine stay at this hotel, while visiting the Carter presidential library and the King Center. The complimentary breakfast and evening cocktail hour are first rate.  The location is nice, with good walking areas nearby."
We enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a very convenient place with access to eating and shopping areas. The kids loved the idea of swimming during this time of year. The indoor pool and jacuzzi did not disappoint
"Couldn't have asked for more!! Clean, top notch service.  Friendly staff.  The ability to provide meals to a large group in a very timely manner.  The room was perfect, the bed was like being at home, and the restaurants were excellent, food and service!"
Stayed at the Wyndham Galleria in Atlanta and was very pleased. The rooms were excellent and the restaurant was great! Plan to enjoy your visit!
"Clean, spacious yet cozy. Wonderful service. Great banquet menu especially the Lemon Cake!!!! Great staff! Superb Complimentary breakfast was excellent and all-encompassing. Hot, cold and made-to-order items galore."
"Very nice and very clean. The staff was very helpful. The food was good. Very close to the airport, you could   ride the tram to the airport. You could get room service until midnight. If you have a car they charge you to park"
"Great hotel, great pricing. Convenient to restaurants, shopping and Atlanta Braves The Battery . Hotel is clean, staff is friendly, food is great (try the homemade potato chips) and the popcorn desert!!!"
This hotel is placed right in the heart of Atlanta and within walking distance to centennial Olympic park and the Georgia aquarium. The service was phenomenal as well as the breakfast. We will stay here again when we return to ATL!
"We had a wonderful experience. The room was beautiful and clean. The staff was friendly.  It was perfectly located for dining, shopping and the conference center."
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. There are many food options and the mall is nearby. It's a good location in reference to downtown and some of the suburbs. The concierge was very understanding and the hotel was so cute.
Tracey served us at the restaurant last night. She was wonderful and had taken care of us on our last visit. Will definitely come back as a result of her exemplary service and recommendations. Thanks Tracey!!
"Clean, spacious, quite, and great breakfast.... all at a reasonable rate.  As long as the rates stay at these rates I will always stays here when visiting Atlanta.  Keep up the good standards and value."
"Very beautiful clean contemporary hotel. The Staff was very friendly, gracious staff. They thanked me for coming and welcomed me back.  Beautiful view of the downtown Atlanta area . Can't wait to stay again. I will  certainly refer friends and family."
"Best hotel stay in a long, long time.  Not just a hotel room, but a suite at hotel room prices.  They had an omelet station in the breakfast area, and it was part of the complimentary breakfast!  Cannot beat it!"
"I have traveled both for business and pleasure throughout the US and Europe. This is probably my worst experience. Beds are not comfortable, water in ""heated pool"" COLD (colder than water in Massachusetts Bay)."
"Average ES, went well.  Employee in Gift Shop was exemplary.  No one to  help with bags though.  Lobby ATM had been frozen too due to too much fraud.  Agree $40/day for parking is pricey but typical for ATL."
"Stayed here courtesy of Delta when we missed our international connection.   Clean and comfortable.   Friendly staff.    Room service food was delicious.   Room was great.   Airport shuttle service runs like clockwork, 24/7."
"This hotel is fantastic in every way.  The #1 pizzeria ( Amalfi) in Atlanta is steps away from hotel. The gym is the best that I have ever seen in any hotel, they have every weightlifting machine. The staff is excellent."
"We recently stayed here when one of the family was in Emory Hospital.  Although hospital stays are tough, Crown Plaza and, Sabra at the front desk in particular, really made us feel at home.  Great staff really makes all the difference."
"Stefan, thank you for your review. Apologies for any time delays you may have experienced at our front desk. We have shared your comments with our team. We hope you will accept our apologies and stay with us again."
"The staff was great.   The food was tasty.    The only issue is the sound transmission under the door.   Really needs to be addressed.  Too much noise from folks talking, etc. in the halls.  Maybe add a door sweep."
"Hyatt is very close to Mercedes Benz footbal stadium, Coke tour, Aquarium, CNN and Centennial Park.  It was also located a few blocks from Marta train system too.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful."
"Staff did best that could be expected with old, outdated facility - no indoor access from rooms to lobby/breakfast area, sloped outdoor walkways, floors creaked, not sound proofed, tiny wastebasket, old toilet, tight parking. Definitely not for disabled people."
We had a wonderful Christmas break and enjoyed our stay at Hyatt place...They went over and above to ensure our comfort.Love their breakfast options for vegetarians..and its always packed with happy customers. Wish their pool was indoor though!
"YouÃ¢ÂÂre very welcome! Thanks for the shout-out about your sonÃ¢ÂÂs big day! WeÃ¢ÂÂre so glad he chose to get married here, and we wish him happiness and harmony. Hope to see you again soon!"
">>Nice hotel experience, very clean and easy to find in the downtown area. Since we went to the Aquarium and the Battle of the bandsl, that was a great for those events. DidnÃ¢ÂÂt like the construction surrounding the hotel though."
"We truly appreciate your comments and appreciate the staff acknowledgement.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon to enjoy our team and hotel again soon.

Thank You,"
"Booked this hotel. Was beyond amazed that the property is even open considering the condition.  Can't believe they even charged for parking with the state of this property.  Go elsewhere!

Completely a construction zon3. Staff was pleasantly but couldn't believe my eyes."
"Our only complaint was that we were only there for one night.

The room was really a suite and the amenities were excellent.

The breakfast was a bit of a let down, but not sufficient to spoil the whole experience."
Stayed in downtown Atlanta for a business seminar.  Very pleased with hotel and staff.  Staff was courteous and meeting space was prepared for us before arrival.  Food was excellent.  Would stay here again.
Great property and the front desk staff really made me feel at home. elegant atmosphere and excellent service I recommend anyone traveling to Atlanta area to choose this property for style and service.
I have stayed at this hotel before.  The rooms have been renovated and are fantastic.  This hotel is next door to a mall with many good restaurants.  I love what they did and I look forward to staying here again.
"This hotel is practically on the Tarmac. Very well situated for easy access in the morning.
The rooms are well appointed and beds comfortable
The real treat is the restaurant. The barbacue ribs are excellent with sweet potato fries.
 The service is excellent also."
"Had dinner, slept over, parking package....perfect! Most comfortable nights sleep in a hotel.....ever! Clean, neat, well maintained and has its own tram for 5 minute ride to airport....yes, please! Love this hotel and will plan to stay here from now on when traveling from ATL."
I will never stay here again. The staff were rude. The hotel was dirty. There were bugs in my bathroom. The food options for both breakfast and the evening reception were very limited. The Fitness center was so nasty!
"I received better service at a hotel chain down the street for half the stay rate but had better accommodations and MUCH friendlier staff! If I had a choice, I would have stay there the remainder of my visit."
"Great location just off highway.  Good value. Breakfast excellent for what you pay.  Hotel is in midtown. Near office buildings, and Israeli Consulate. Lots  of good restaurants within walking distance. Would stay at this hotel again when visiting Atlanta."
"This is the BEST hotel in Atlanta.  I have often stayed at the Ritz Carlton but after this trip it will be the Mandarin Oriental.  A true 5 star luxury experience from the property to the staff to the food.

A great weekend."
"Stayed for one day this week and I would come back. Only four year old hotel, rooms felt new to me. Staff was very helpful, nice little bar and lounge downstairs. Very close to several goods dining options."
my room was very dirty and outdated my shower was not clean hair was on my sheets   lobby was extemly nice bedfast ends at 9 am who is up at that time the need to have it until 10am However night manger was very nice
"My main concern is cleanliness and they were! I have a 15 month old son and appreciate the clean and quite space.  Cute decor and comfortable as well. We will definitely visit again and would recommend to friends.  Very convenient to restaurants, shopping and entertainment."
"Visited whilst in Buckhead. Superb hotel. Great bar. Staff very helpful and great customer service. Would highly recommend and would stay again. Pool super and zen garden is lovely.
Breakfast in cassis was very calm and enjoyable."
I had a 25th wedding anniversary party for my sister at this hotel. Everyone was very professional and friendly. The rooms were great. I would definitely use them again.
"Nice spacious room.  Workout room and pool were clean and available throughout the day.  Nice patio area with a grill! The staff was very friendly and helpful, the hotel was updated and clean, breakfast was great!  Wonderful experience.  Would stay again."
"The staff were great and so was the restaurant. The room was nice, clean and very well located. I enjoy the setup of the bed being in a separate room. I also love the fact that there was a refrigerator already located in the room."
"Thx. so much for your comments. We have passed them on to our team. We apologize for any inconvenience, but we're so glad you enjoyed much of your stay with us during your business trip. Please come back and stay with us again!"
Reservations were for 4; only 3 towels put in room.  Bathroom ceiling falling in above tub.  Parties outside elevators at night on one floor when went looking for a soda machine.  It was out of order.
"We had nice rooms that were clean and well supplied.  None of us realized (probably didn't read far enough) that charge for WIFI in rooms is $12 per day - free in lobby and lounge.
Very quiet atmosphere in our rooms."
My niece decided to have her wedding & reception here.  We were able to stay there and be together for as a family for 5 days.  We met and re-connected with friends and family.  My time there was very peaceful.
"This hotel was clean, comfortable, and worth the price. We enjoyed the indoor pool. The staff was friendly. Checkin and checkout were a breeze. Too bad they don't have a laundry room but that is no deal breaker. We would definitely stay here again."
"Janet is a great person especially after a long day at work. She remembers your name and learns your favorites.  She is a great conversationalist, when starting here make sure you go down and let her take care of you."
"Customer service was great!  Atlanta Grille bar was unique and outstanding!  You have to try the octopus appetizer!  Also, try the Shiraz Hermitage 2015. Walking distance to other great restaurants.  Definitely wtill go back!"
"The good,  the rooms are clean,  could add More channel choices.  Has a sports bar and barber.  Good little deli.   Quiet floor for flight crews.  Van service can be slow due to airport traffic.   Would like to see more vans at peak times."
Very good location and nice venue. Will suggest to anyone.  Parking payments are kind of steep though. Get the rooms with access to the snacks and breakfast.  Will save you time and money.  Will be coming back.
Hotel was great even with constant going on. I am a patient at Emory Hospital and normally stay downtown. Rate was better and hotel was very clean. The staff was pleasant and friendly. Room was outstanding.
Nice set up with a little kitchen. The hotel seemed to be in pretty good shape overall. Front desk service needs improvement. The shuttle service was very convenient. The breakfast with the omelette bar was a nice touch.
"Terrible night got in at 11 turn ac down, woke up sweating at 2:30 , ac was broke . Suffered tru rather than move in the middle of the night. Front desk said they could do nothing because I booked on line"
"Great location-right across from The Fox Theatre and great staff who go out of their way to accommodate guests. This hotel has undergone a recent face lift too. The only drawback is the tiny bathrooms, but the rooms themselves are quite comfortable and quiet."
Very convenient to downtown and has a grocery store within walking distance. It's valet only which is a little annoying and an additional charge but that is par for the course with most Atlanta hotels.
"My stay at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta was a real disappointment, due to the hotel rooms being poorly maintained and the elevators not working properly.  It is would very difficult to return or to recommend this hotel to any of my friends or business acquaintances."
"The best service ever! Front Desk, Sales and Catering, Housekeeping and Maintenance all were fantastic. The food was great and well. I definitely recommend them for any event. The hospitality was great."
"I enjoyed my stay. Everyone of the staff members were very friendly, helpful and I might add had a smile on their face. The bed quality was great.  I slept peacefully and the breakfast selection was great with friendly staff"
Our stay at the Wyndam during Thanksgiving and always has been great.  It's a beautiful hotel and the people are very friendly and helpful.
You will not be disappointed in this hotel.  The staff is awesome and the hotel is awesome. The breakfasts were substantial and very good and the evening social was a meal complete with beer and wine. Rooms were large and comfortable with full kitchens.
The hotel room is in shabby condition. Linens look dingy. But staff was helpful. Housekeeping failed to make up room after first night. CouldnÃ¢ÂÂt reach housekeeping by phone. Had to go to front desk to get clean towels.
The service was outstanding clean and Jeffrey was an awesome customer service person.food delicious at restaurant as well.
"The reception area is adorned with welcoming smiles especially by Nadeeja Adero!  She always
speaks to the guests and is genuinely concerned about their stay.  Exceptional value for the accommodations. We have stayed at this Wyndham at least 4 times and it is consistent."
"Perfectly well-appointed large city hotel (albeit with temperamental smart cards) but I'm disappointed having upgraded to Club to discover that the ""evening hors d'oeuvres"" come with soft drinks. Hors d'oeuvres with Sprite. Not what one expects from such a lounge and such service."
Abdul (room service) was fantatic!  Great service.  We were there for a business conference and it was a smooth process from start to finish.  I would recommend this hotel for conferences.  The staff was very responsive.
"Needed a place to crash overnight while travelling through Atlanta and this Country Inn was perfect. The rooms are a little dated but neat & tidy. Nothing fancy, but the price was right and the service was friendly."
Very good hotel with exceptionally friendly staff.lovely environment. Breakfast and happy hour was excellent. Strongly recommend fir a business or family holiday. Lenox plaza an excellent mall a walking distance.
"Would definitely stay here again!!! Great staff, clean room, excellent services.  Managers are always on site, and walk around to meet guest expectations, and to answer any questions that they may have.Only disappointment was free wifi . . . .poor quality"
We are glad you son had a good time in the pool here at the Embassy Suites Hotel Atlanta Airport and would like to thank you for such a nice review. We hope to be able to see you again soon.
This is a boutique hotel slowly transitioning into something new but still very beautiful. The staff is friendly. The food and drinks were good.There is a parking deck close by if you chose not to valet. It was an enjoyable experience.
"What a great review, thank you!  WeÃ¢ÂÂre thrilled to hear that the Atlanta Marriott Buckhead Hotel & Conference Center was able to meet your expectations and offered you a quiet, clean and well appointed stay.  Your suggestion will be shared with our team."
"Great location, exceptional staff - it's close to business and good restaurants. I was there only one night and almost stayed closer to the airport, but will gladly make an effort to stay here again on my next visit to the area."
We apologize for the issues that have been brought up in this review.  We will make sure to correct these issues immediately.
"the material used outside of hotel, for the flooring very slippery esp in rain. parking little to no parking. beds online say queen, but are actually twin/full size. the room was clean but the bathroom, you could barely turnaround in there."
Every staff member warmly.greets me with a smile. The entire visit is wonderful. Whenever I travel to Atlanta my first choice is the Renaissance. It is such a convenient location. The valet price is reasonable. The rooms are appointed beautifully.
Wonderful place to stay-very spacious room. Room service was very prompt and the food was delicious.  The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean. Everyone was very nice and helpful. Great location.
We were upgraded to a view room with Club access. Well worth it! Evening appetizers and continental breakfast were both plentiful and delicious. Staff was attentive and accommodating. Would highly recommend a stay here in the beautiful Buckhead area of Atlanta.
"Renovations going on, so a bit chaotic during the normal operations.  Staff appeared to allow children to be loud and unsupervised in the lobby area, even late at night.  HVAC did not cool the room below 74.  Breakfast was great and morning staff was friendly."
"This is the 2nd time I've stayed at this hotel, and it was as good as I remember it being.  The staff are exceptionally thoughtful and attentive.  The room I stayed in was very clean and well appointed.  I would happily stay here again."
We LOVED our stay! Very clean- very comfortable. Will definitely stay there the next time we travel to Atlanta. The staff truly goes above and beyond to make your stay very comfortable and memorable. Valet parking is a must.
"We enjoyed hosting you , thank you for choosing us and thanks for traveling."
"Hotel was great overall, especially for the value.  The lounge being closed on the weekend is rough, but they did give breakfast buffet vouchers to make up for it.  Staff was extremely nice.  You really felt the southern hospitality."
"Friendly staff, room was spacious, clean and bright.  Continental breakfast hit the spot with a good selection of hot and cold items, not to mention the free shuttle back and forth to the airport was much appreciated!"
"Room not ready on time, waited an additional hour until we could check in and get room. The premise is clean and was close to business we had. The reception and breakfast are a bonus and were both good."
"Hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. The bar area is very nice. Even though the hotel was full, there was no noise in the room from other guests. 
I was there for a music conference and the conference facilities were also clean and comfortable."
Room accommodations were comfortable and clean.   Hotel was quiet.   Breakfast was pleasant and had enough variety.   Would recommend this hotel.  Ive stayed here at least 10 times and it is always a good experience.
"Nice room and very comfortable bed. Staff was super - friendly and helpful. Parking also good. Good location when arriving with car from the interstate.
However, breakfast was ridiculously expensive.  And with no refrigerator in the room the average rating went down for us."
Beautiful hotel architecturally wonderful looking atrium breathtaking was there for a convention and found the location to be superb. Within walking distance to all of the local Atlanta attractions. Would stay there again in a minute beautiful place
"The ballrooms were beautiful. Checkin and checkout were very smooth. The hotel room was very clean. The king size bed was amazing! The outdoor pool on the third floor was nice and heated. The food from the wedding was okay, very small portions."
"I guess it just in our blood, thanks for staying"
"All the staff were very friendly and showed a real interest in where I had come from. Only ""negative"" was the bar, it did not seem to have much atmosphere, a bit too bright and cold looking.  Don't let that put you off though."
"Lobby is gorgeous and comfy. Absolutely love the fireplace and lounge-y furniture! Room is well appointed and bed very comfortable--quiet, too! Stayed only one night but the desk staff checking me in and out remembered me--super professional!"
"Great staff, convenient location. Front desk, valet and restaurant staff were very accommodating. Looking forward to coming back to Atlanta, will definitely stay here. Embassy Suites are well worth the money for the size room and amenities you receive."
"My room was clean , bed was comfortable. Called the front desk for extra towels and got them quickly . Our flight was delayed and the front desk gave us a later check out with no problems . Will definitely stay again !"
Rooftop bar was AMAZING....great views outstanding service from Keyatta to Caroline to stephanie check in was great Stay here any time your im the heart of Atlanta.  FYI it's right beside Georgia Aquarium
I had previously made reservation  with special ratesand the rates where not applied. Not enough  I had to go daily to the reception to get new keys issued to enter our room because the keys or cards where not working.
"We are all really happy that you enjoyed your stay, glad that Jerrome was able to assist"
The hotel is very nice on the inside but the staff is very rude . I will never visit this location again.They have a nice breakfast  and fitness facility. I rented to rooms to celebrate my daughter birthday. This was a big disappointment.
On behalf of the hotel staff we apologize that we did not exceed your expectations. There is no excuse for a half eaten sandwich left in the refrigerator. We will find out which housekeeper was responsible for that room and take appropriate action.
What his hotel was perfect Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ¾ amazing food Ã°ÂÂ¥Â right next to the dome! If u want to stay in the best hotel down town and sleep and eat like a king Ã°ÂÂ¤Â´Ã°ÂÂÂ¾ go to the Omni.........Nice service all over 5 stars
"My overall stay was awesome.  All of the staff was extremely polite and very friendly from the valet, check in (very awesome and greeted you each time you entered the building). Love it.  Just love the staff!"
I really enjoyed staying here! The hotel is a little dated but the complimentary breakfast and evening reception as well as the other amenities make up for it. The staff was kind and helpful and the room was comfortable.
The location was very convenient to everything! The staff was amazing and very accommodating.  I always felt welcomed.  I will definitely recommend this property and definitely will come back when I'm in Atlanta
We were the FIRST guests in this brand new hotel!! Although construction was going on it was still beautiful. The entry stairwell is going to be incredible! EVERYONE was incredibly nice; from the Valet to the Hotel Staff. Go see them! WE WILL BE BACK!
"Welcomed with a smile and warm cookies, followed by a beautiful, convenient, remodeled room.  Easy parking, tremendous access to shopping and a wide variety of restaurants.  We plan to stay at the DoubleTree on our next trip to Atlanta."
The supremely comfortable beds in the spacious accommodations made the stay sublime. The convenient location and helpful staff  were added bonuses. Would heartily recommend this property for anyone looking for a relaxing stay in a great location.
"We spent one night at this hotel and chose it because of its location. The staff was very pleasant and helpful, the room modern and comfortable. We especially appreciated the breakfast buffet -- great selection of dishes and fresh fruit. We'd definitely stay there again."
Great option for out of town guests! Amazing price and great location.  The The location of this hotel is perfect. You are a short Uber drive to Midtown and Buckhead.  They have a shuttle that will take you within a 4 mile radius.
Friendly staff and updated accommodations make this Embassy Suites an easy choice. The new Braves ballpark is within walking distance. Breakfast is very good and rooms are large. This is my location of choice
"Excellent service and hospitality all across the board, the bar atmosphere amazing the bartenders Caren and queenlyn were highly professional and courteous so five stars i would highly recommend to my friends"
IÃ¢ÂÂm very satisfied with the location of the hotel. The hotel is nice and clean. All the employees are very nice and you feel very welcome here. The service is great. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.
Great customer service and friendly staff. We have a large family and the room was very comfortable. We enjoyed swimming in the indoor outdoor pool. There were great restaurants in walking distance. The valet was extra helpful and friendly. We would stay here again.
"I travel a lot for work and usually stay at Homewood Suites.  This one was the BEST!!  The staff at this Homewood is extremely personable, friendly, and HELPFUL!!!  We stay here again, again, and AGAIN!! Hated to leave."
"Always good to stay at any Hyatt hotel! WeÃ¢ÂÂve stayed at multiple and itÃ¢ÂÂs always the same pleasant experience. Staff is friendly, all clean, nice rooms, breakfast included and its good too. Great experience."
Wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else. The room was clean and the hotel in close proximity to all events I was attending downtown. The hotel was also quiet with a responsive staff and plenty of amenities.
Fabulous hotel and great staff.  Our stay was great and the room was huge!  Big enough for our family of 7.  The evening reception was more like a full meal and the hotel staff was so friendly and accommodating.
We're so sorry our in-room dining experience was not to your liking. But we're glad to hear that our colleagues could be of service and that you enjoyed our bedding! We hope you'll come back and stay with us again!
we stayed here one night while at market because of the national championship game happening.  The hotel was very nice.  Nice rooms bed was ok.  Hotel was fine for one night.  location was not good for us so we switched the next night
"Fantastic hotel with very friendly staff and great overall service. Rooms well maintained and decor is comfortable and sufficient for trips for business.
Bar is fantastic and even managed to spot the odd film star drinking quietly with a friend. Overall brilliant stsy"
"This review is for Rucha- she brought our lunch to our room when room service wasnÃ¢ÂÂt even available on Sunday, July 8th, 2018. She was so pleasant and professional. Her customer service was impeccable!Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ½Ã°ÂÂ¤Â"
"From the valet to the lobby to the room (see pictures) , quality at its best. I found the $99 price through the hotel's website and was amazed when i walked through the doors. Great location in Downtown Atlanta and friendly and helpful staff."
"Internet was down, tub didn't drain and the hair drier didn't work.  Nobody seemed to care.  Breakfast was pretty good and the beds were pretty comfortable.  The location was pretty good.  We wouldn't recommend this hotel."
"Thx. so much for your review, and for being our guest. We're very sorry parts of your stay we're not to your liking. We've passed your comments on to our team. We hope you'll stay with us again!"
"Central location for Atlanta and near by many great places to dine in or have a coffee/beverage.

Hotel property was stunning and rooms were unbelievable!

Incredible corner room with a view!

Hotel staff was friendly and I cannot say enough about this hotel!"
"The stay itself was great ,Easily accessible to restaurants, shopping and transport. Rather disappointed with the gym and that there was no pool. Service was good and they had a great daily breakfast."
After check out left medication in the room. Could not motivate weekend staff to retrieve much needed medication. Monday morning staff retrieved medication. Was given a much deserved reward. However now medication had to be Fedex at our expense.
I really enjoyed staying at the Four Seasone in Atlanta . The srevice the food and the rooms were excellent !!  Margot Bar was great the Hamburger was awesome .Next time I go back I will bring my wife and stay longer .
"Our family got waylaid in Atlanta by weather.  We had to catch an early flight the next morning.  The staff went out of their way to help us get as much rest as possible, and still catch our plane ion the morning.  Awesome staff/service."
I stayed here during a trip to Atlanta and was very satisfied. The staff members were friendly and the hotel room was clean. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the buckhead Marta station which was great for avoiding Atlanta traffic.
"Hotel has water that smells like body odor and does not really care to do anything about it. Spoke to desk, housekeeping and engineering and they all just shrugged and said ""only a few people are complaining""."
my first time to ATL and I stayed here. Very nice. Beds are comfy. Staff was very friendly. Across the street to train for easy access to airport and Lenox Mall...and tons of restaurants. I definitely recommend this hotel
"We stay here every year for con.  Love the way the staff dress up and get involved in our fun weekend.  Great weekend everytime!  Hallways are long and confusing but once you get the layout, you can get around easily.  The pool is awesome!"
"Great hotel for business or pleasure. The entire hotel was very clean and welcoming. Staff members were very nice and helpful.  The breakfast food was standard, but nice to have in the morning. The manager's reception was very nice."
"I had a wonderful time staying at Embassy Suites in Atlanta, GA. The service was great. Breakfast and the reception was great. The workers were very polite and helpful in answer my questions that I had."
"We came in for the mother's day brunch and the food was amazing, the staff was friendly, and the decorations were so great! I really like the new lounge and restaurant space as well. I look forward to coming back."
"The best front desk staff I've ever come across in all my travels! Lovely,  classically furnished rooms,  and a nice little bar. Great location if you're going to a concert at Chastain Park. Will definitely be back!"
The hotel staff was friendly and I love it. That hotel will be my family vacation spot for years to come as long as the service stays the same. I was welcomed with open arms and provided with quality service
"Stayed in this hotel twice, at the start and at the end of our Deep South tour. Nice rooms, comfortable beds. needs an upgrade, cheap wooden doors. No water, free Wi Fi. Remote area near highway so some rooms can be noisy. Breakfast buffet OK."
Bugs and poor customer service.  Management never contacted me in tegards to these concerns after i was told that they should call within 48 hours.  Room was not ready at check in time.  Digital check in pointless.
"A great place to stay close to SunTrust Park and great restaurants.  Comfortable rooms, quiet, clean, great coffee and breakfast.  We always stay here when we come to Atlanta. Friendly, helpful, professional staff."
"2 room suites have separate bathrooms and large common living/dining/kitchen area.  Great for long term or short term stay, and for families.  Breakfast is free and very good.  Located in Buckhead, near downtown, and not far from a large shopping and restaurant complex."
"Generally clean, convenient and pleasant staff. Perfect location for Braves games with very convenient hotel shuttle to the game. Plenty of places nearby for dining and a few are walkable. Hotel has a pool, fitness room and business center. Full restaurant and bar."
"Love this place.  Stayed for the Tech/Tennessee game and everything was great as usual.   Free wifi is great, and location is perfect for walking to midtown restaurants.  Coffee shops, the bookstore, and restaurants are all walking distance."
Good stay great location only downfall was the valet parking this hotel was not in a busy downtown area so there was no need for valet parking this was a simple way for the hotel to make money and nickel and dime customers
Always excellent! My go to hotel in Atlanta. Location is great. Bar is really good although sometimes crowded and Art & Soul restaraunt is top notch.  Love to be able to walk to a Lenox and Marta. Way on off the 400.
"The hotel is located  across the street from Lennox Mall. The outside was clean, valets greet you as you arrive. The lobby was clean and looked great. The room was looked good and was clean, with a great view."
"Clean room. Only reason for giving a 4/5 is, every time we got a shower it set the smoke detector off when we opened the bathroom door. Parking sucks also, but common in Atlanta. Great view of city though."
"The staff is pretty great here, especially Michelle. They all make such great effort to show great customer service and even ask us our names and how our days are going. Will definitely be staying here again."
"For a suite this was just way too small of a bathroom. Also, I've never stayed at a hotel before where there is no cover to load/unload your luggage and it was drizzling rain. All in all not a good experience for us."
Short family trip made easy.The Renissance is a beautiful unique hotel. Very convenient to the airport. Very friendly staff top notch service. Enjoyed all  the food. Would definitely recommend and stay here again. Ã°ÂÂÂ
The Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. They made us feel welcome as soon as we walked in the door. The room was clean and comfortable and loved the bed. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Can't beat the cookie at check in!
"Two friends and I stayed here while attending a Radiohead concert. Drove down from Charlotte, NC for a weekend getaway.  Hotel was great.  Clean, comfortable, & staff was very accommodating.  Close to everything.  Valet was fast.  No complaints here."
"Our big family has stayed at Embassy Suites for reunions in DENVER, SAN ANTONIO, and ATLANTA. E.S. has always been affordable as well as comfortable. It's dÃÂ©cor is pleasing and we enjoy the extra seating areas where we play games or watch football."
This Hyatt place was really excellent. The staff was super friendly and could not have been nicer. I would recommend this hotel and location. The room was very spacious and clean. Great experience. Thank you
Everything went well. The experience was of a professional manner. I enjoyed all of amenities the hotel offered. The room was quiet and very restful. I had everything I needed from the moment I arrived.
Really nice to get a room that's more like a mini efficiency apartment than anything else makes you feel right at home. The staff is friendly courteous kind and very very helpful meals are great as well
"The lobby was beautifully decorated.  The food was delicious. The service at the front desk, in the restaurant, in the bar was friendly and welcoming. Everyone greeted us. The grounds were gorgeous....even in December! Will be sure to return to this hotel!"
Our entire team is so happy that everything was perfect during your visit with us! We look forward to seeing you again soon!
"Clean hotel. Nothing fancy, but nothing missing. Close to bars, restaurants and Starbucks. Staff was very helpful and had the right information at the right time. Able to recommend good bars and restaurants. Very accommodating."
Nice place for family to stay or transit. The Airport shuttle bus has made it so easy after disembarkation to use the complimentary shuttle bus and check in smoothly. It was a homely experience for us and we hope to be back.
"I stayed at this hotel for 11 nights and I got to say, for a first time visit to the United States, it was very great! the staff was awesome. Guys like Troy and Yvedell were really helpful when I asked for anything."
"This hotel was clean, the staff was friendly, and it was close to a lot of things in Atlanta. When we first walked in, we were welcomed with a smile. Our room was clean, and the bed was super comfortable."
"Location, location, location. This hotel is right off I-75, which makes for easy on-off highway access for travelers. It's also situated very close to some excellent Midtown restaurants. Staff was friendly, and our room was clean and comfortable."
Decent hotel! Still bothered by the channel selections and the TV leaned against the wall on top of a dressor with no base and a TV mount on the back! Very small beds! No microwave or frig!
Hotel was nice and room was pleasant.  I thought the breakfast was pretty mediocre and wifi got congested during peak hours.  Overall good stay but probably would go to a Marriott instead for the price point
Great location just about 20 minutes  from everything like downtown Atlanta and MLK museum. If your flying airport is close by. If you may have forgotten something small and simple family dollars and Walmart are nearby.
Excellent experience ! My home away from home. The staff was amazing and very accommodating to our needs.  The personalized service is amazing ! This hotel is located in the center of the best shopping and restaurants options in ATL.
The hotel has an excellent location in Decatur area and the free parking benefit. It is a great property and I highly recommend this hotel being from Hotel Management background for 25+ years in the past.
We stayed at the hotel this past weekend and everything was great. Very unique mix of modern and historical. The location was convenient to other parts of the city. Would stay there again in a heartbeat!
This gentleman was very helpful and professional. Showed appreciated concern about me not wearing a coat in the cold weather. Very kind and pleasant. Asked co worker to go get a rack for my items and helped every customer that came.
The linens on the bed were threadbare and stained.  The pillows had solid rock hard lumps in them.  Housekeeping staff did not replace stained and dirty linens.  The hotel did not refund any money.  The restaurant did not bring the food ordered.
"Keep giving it a chance for some reason, but checked in this time to makeup on the pillow, a filthy bathroom and my desk chair looks like it's decaying.

Friendly cafe staff and convenient location are the only positives I'm able to come up with."
This is a fantastic hotel and I would love to go back again. The front desk lady was very friendly and the staff in the bar was very nice too. I love the steam room and sauna room. It is the best. Strongly recommend it.
"Latoya was amazing , she made sure that everything we need was done ASAP. From towel derive to room service and even helped with other places in the area. Job well done. I would recommend this hotel to anyone thatÃ¢ÂÂs traveling to Atlanta"
Great experience staying at Four Seasons ATL. They truly make you feel right at home.  We were in town for a convention. We had a great location to get to and from the convention center. Plenty of restaurants in walking distance. Overall great experience.
"Ms Debra, Sean and Quintianna the drivers were awesome  the other hotel staff Janelle,Robin,and Dianna assisted in starting your morning off great and ending your evenings. A huge thank you to them all"
Suite very well suited to hold more than 2 guests. Kitchen is cozy and all appliances work. Comfortable during the winter especially with fireplace. Food and leisure is walking distance or Uber close.
My wife and I came in for a short stay. The atmosphere and employees were great. Very attentive and friendly. Breakfast was more than the regular continental. We were in walking distance to shopping and restaurants. Will definitely be back.
"""Funky"" is the perfect word to describe our property. Funky, edgy, cool, BOLD. At W Atlanta-Buckhead we are a lifestyle brand and we love taking care of our guests."
Absolutely beautiful Hotel for a Wedding. The gardens are beautifully landscaped and the heart shaped seating makes it a perfect setting. Hotel stay was great. We had transportation to the Mall. Very accommodating. Room overlooking the gardens was amazing. Great service. Free garage parking.
"Very nice room and priced right. Two things, however. First - have free wi-fi shouldn't be that complicated.  Also - a refrigerator in the room would be a fantastic addition."
"Recently remodeled this hotel is an absolute gem!!!! Fitness center, bar area, rooms are one of the best in the chain of Embassy there is. Went from ok to TOP NOTCH. The staff was always great but with the new change they are even better!!!!!!!"
"The location is great. the room was clean and smell fresh. The hotel was in great condition.  The valet service, check in and room service met my expectations. The staff was courteous and address all my needs."
Great location. The hotel is within walking distance of many attractions. Friendly staff and good breakfast. We had many food options for breakfast. The room was very nice. We had many premium channels.
"A great hotel situated downtown close to Marta and the CNN Center/Aquarium/World of Coke. An amazing staff, well lead with great wifi and a great breakfast each morning. Great rooms, comfy beds and great reviews."
The Mandarin is an excellent choice for a business meeting or a romantic getaway. Quiet with a phenomenal staff. Rooms are clean and comfortable and the location is a plus.   Always enjoyable because of the way they treat guests. First class!
"Great hotel with great staff. We had problems with housekeeping on the first night but front desk solved the problem after I asked them.
Just six parking spaces for disabled person and the space doesn't have enough room for a wheelchair."
"Steps away from GT - a wonderful hotel and great staff! Special thanks to Lakeisha for going the extra mile and saving the day!! My number one choice in Atlanta - great location, clean and pretty rooms!"
"The hotel was underwhelming,  however,  the wonderful staff made up for what was lacking. Bellman ""Shakil"" went above and beyond with managing my luggage.  The ladies at the front desk were very professional and made me feel like more than just "" another guest""."
We stayed in a corner room. It was very large and clean. Location is also vey good. Close to restaurants and underground. Staff was friendly.They reccomend some good restaurants. They provided a crib for our baby.
This hotel was awesome! The staff knew we had driven a long way and sought out a room for me and my family check in early! Hotel was very clean and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent as usual. I will use again.
"The property manager went out of their way to ensure that my sister (whom had recent breast cancer surgery) and her husband who were visiting my wife and I from Arizona, received and got the very best in service and care!!!!! I ""THANK-YOU"""
We enjoyed the spacious double room and the quietness the room provided. Very clean and didnÃ¢ÂÂt smell like febreeze. Check in and out was very easy. The valets were very friendly and knew the area well.
Awesome hotel!!! Must stay if traveling to the Atlanta area! Great bar and restaurant staff. Food is great and the complimentary drinks are nice. The complimentary breakfast is delicious! Always a pleasure staying here!
"Room ok but expected better quality considering it is a Westin hotel. Coffee packs too big for coffee pot in the room. Parking high but valet personnel were friendly and helpful. Bar area nice, very busy."
Good value for the money.  Clean.  Quiet.  No frills but great location for Braves games.  (1/2 mile walk)  Good breakfast that's well attended.  Don't rely on shuttle van to stadium.  Too small and ends its runs 2 hours before game time.
Hotel is refusing to let people know that rooms are being upgraded which means that there is non-stop construction noise in the hotel. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre charging top dollar and putting you in a room with construction noise going on continuously throughout the day. Ridiculous and unacceptable.
Park your car and enjoy the location. The staff at Hyatt House we're phenomenal! The location was just what we needed. Didn't have to drive at all. The best eaterys and museums. But this hotel was great for us.
"We recently stayed at the Embassy Suites in the Buckhead area of Atlanta.  The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of the MARTA, many restaurants, and a       huge shopping mall. Staff and friendly and courteous.  The value for the money was excellent."
"The room was fantastic, the complimentary breakfast was way beyond what i was expecting, the staff was courteous, everything about my stay was perfect. I wouldn't have changed one thing! The desk manager cameron was also a very great person."
Very rude staff. From valet to house keeping. My family and I stayed and was discriminated against. They did not even try to hide it! No courtesy we where treated as unwanted guest. I guess they only want certain type of people in this hotel.
"Excellent hotel, great beds, great views and walking distance to all things downtown.Excellent hot showers, 25 hour snack bar and breakfast items available for a nominal cost. The staff was awesome,and we checked in and out with a lobby full of guests."
The hot water did not work in our suite but the management moved us to an upgrade and adjusted our bill. The pool and hot tub were very nice and the parking garage was convenient and free. Loved the full breakfast!
"Fantastic service all around from everyone working to take care of us. 
Breakfast room food excellent and very accommodating! Perfect location for attending grandsons graduation. No more words required"
"Spacious room and bath were clean, well appointed, knowledgeably managed.  Affable staff. The room contains a lighted armoire.  Coffee pot is the one-cup variety.  Accommodations need a few more drawers."
"Room was small and dark. Lobby was he same. On a positive note, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is really good if you plan on shopping at Lenox Square or other places in Buckhead. The valet parking was high, $40 daily."
"Hotel room was clean and modern decor. Hotel overall is nice. However cleaning care are loud and knocks your door even when the not disturb sign is on. Gym is a very nice with a good selection of treadmills, ellipticals and free weights"
"We stay here when going to Americasmart. Clean, nice, and an easy walk to downtown. Great hotel for traveling to market and it really helps that it connects to the mall's food court too. Overall a great and easy place to stay."
We had a very positive experience.  Easy check-in and check-out.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The only negative was the slowness in which the breakfast staff cleaned tables.  And the cookie was good.
"We could not ask for a better place to stay in Buckhead Atlanta. Everything about this place was awesome. The staff was very knowledgeable in the restaurants, shopping and things to do in the area. Customer Service was excellent."
I was greeted by nice valet. Checked in by a beautiful brunette. And a friendly bellman showed me to my room. Didn't really get to look around the hotel but the experience was luxurious. Great view from room as well. Will come back again.
I was pleased with my first experience at this hotel. Customer service was excellent and our room was a little small but really nice and clean. A very nice weekend getaway and I would definitely return!
everything within walking distance.  helpful staff. thank you GWEN for helping with the sauna. People at the executive lounge are always ready to help and look after you. over all the right place to be in at Buckhead.
All was great except my car was damage by AAA. The car service they used. Other then that I would recommend them to friends and family.   They can use an updated restaurant menu as it had some items not likable.
"Stayed here overnight en route back home. Suite was immaculate, beds were incredibly comfortable and complimentary breakfast was had a good assortment of items. I will stay here again next time through Atlanta."
Clean and friendly employees.  Stayed here once before and will stay again.  I would recommend this place.
"Marriott in Buckhead is a standard 4 star hotel, with the expected quality and service. It is located close go Lenox  square with many shops around and walking distance from some good restaurants. 
The gym is good 24/7."
"It is our pleasure to serve, thank you for your business and comments."
Nice pre flight overnight. Felt safe with attendant at entrance/parking area. Did not get breakfast due to very early departure. Room had been remodeled and was simple but clean. Would stay again before easy am plane flight.
We enjoyed our 2 nights and 3 days at the Wyndham. The rooms were updated as was the whole facility. Staff was excellent.
And the best part is that is only one part of a really nice Christmas Holiday.  Low occupancy did not mean low staff--they were attentive and helpful.  Thanks to all of them.
"Very clean room, comfortable bed. 5 min airport shuttle. Staff friendly and helpful (Yavonne). Excellent choice if heading to the airport. Several restaurants within walking distance. Malone's next door is very good. Would definitely stay here again."
"Stayed here during a conference and trade show at the Galleria. Very nice hotel, with courteous and friendly staff. There's a walkway from the hotel to the Galleria, though it can be hard to find the first time. Shopping and restaurants close by."
We stayed overnight before our flight.  The evening snacks and drinks were great.  The breakfast was great.  The accommodations were great.  The airport shuttle was timely and comfortable.  Would recommend to anyone flying out of atlanta.
"Special commendations to Ade, who was super friendly and helpful.  Hotel is nice nice nice and convenient to the hospital. Peter in the upstairs restaurant offered great service and friendly smile. The food was absolutely excellent as well."
"The hotel was nice a few minor things, that can easily  be fix the valet parking,breakfast need to be a little hotter,more staff at night, ,paying extra for Parking is Ridiculous, did not like glass doors in bathroom"
"I left my jacket when we departed. Thank you Toni Dickerson for getting my jacket shipped back to me. We had great service during our day and after.  Great place to stay for location    and connivence.  

Thanks
Renee"
"We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and that our team could be of service. Thx. so much for being our guest. Please come back again, soon!"
"Overall the hotel was quite nice. Recently renovated, good location, and modern. Recently became a Marriott Gold member and was expecting more...sadly no. Everyone receives free internet, everyone has to pay for breakfast."
"Convenient location for Olympic Park, museums, sports venues and convention facilities. Car traffic messy, so plan to walk.  Excellent and varied restaurants nearby with reasonable prices.  Aloft well maintained and staff very friendly."
I love this place.  Every staff member we met was a 10+.  The room was perfect and Extremely well maintained.  The common areas are spacious and well appointed.  The food was very well prepared in the restaurant.  I highly recommend this hotel!
As I have been touring in August. This is an another brilliant hotel. We were astonished at their prompt airport transfer service. The lobby ambience is brilliant and the bar too. The front desk is full of warmth in nature. Truly a great business hotel.
"Recently visited Hyatt Place North stayed several times, I love the clean fresh smell in the lobby area. The workers are great and have very nice personalities! I would recommend staying here. The room was comfortable"
"Staff VERY courteous and polite. Very helpful. Rooms clean, no issues. Pleanty of amenities. The staff know exacthow to do their job. Excellent value for our group rate. Thanks for the great job. I will stay here next time."
"Room was not serviced even after requesting twice to the staff. Besides that, guests need to go take the laundry at the reception (no delivery to the rooms available). Staff not very friendly... way to go to be a good hotel"
Reserved on line same day as check-in for $89 + Tax. Check-in was fast & very friendly. Room was clean and well supplied. Breakfast was good with nice selection. And Good coffee! Would definitely stay here again.
"I recently traveled here for work and had meetings each day at the hotel. It was a pleasant trip, all the staff was so friendly and the rooms were very clean. i also had a delicious salad and glass of wine at the bar."

Impeccable cleanliness, the amazing breakfasts.
100% recommendable. We will return for sure."
"This was the best hotel I have ever stayed at.  Good value with clean and comfortable rooms.  The service by every staff member was fabulous.  The morning breakfast offered had variety, healthy choices and plenty of quantity."
Outstanding accommodations and service during our 2 night stay. Great attention to details. Assistant Manager James was personally involved with guest satisfaction. Will be a committed Marriot guest from now on.
"The front of house staff were trained exceptionally well and were the jewel of this property.  Could not have been more attentive, professional and helpful.  Joe, the house car driver, was a wealth of information relating to restaurants off the beaten path."
I have been to a million of hotels and this is the biggest room I have every been too. Breakfest is okay. People are nice. Veiw is amazing you get to see dowtown atlanta. It was beituful. Only problem is elavator takes so so long.
"The experience at the hotel has surpassed my expectations. It was a very good service, amenities and location with a fair rate. Other hotels from the chain at this city has higher rates and lower quality. I would recommend this location for business travelers."
"Location is not far from the airport and handled our large size group with no problems.  The comp. breakfast in the morning was fresh and tasty.  The evening reception was quite nice also.  Enjoy your stay at this property, I did."
Stayed at Atlanta Mandarin Oriental for business meeting.   Hotel is on  par with any luxury hotel.  Staff was pleasant and accommodating.  Facilities were excellent.  Nice location in Buckhead area of Atlanta
Excellent property for the value. The room is spacious with great amenities. The bed is very comfortable (king size) The lighting is great. the bathroom is spacious and luxurious. The staff is very attentive. The evening turn down service is great.
"I am actually booking a mini vaca and chose this hotel due to a great past experience.  Gorgeous Buckhead area with nearby restaurants, movie theatre and other attractions.  I look forward to returning to this location very soon!"
This is a very nice Hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I will be staying again when I'm in the Atlanta area.
"This hotel is off the main highway thus helping reduce the traffic noise at night and early in the morning. Very close to Cumberland mall and many restaurant choices. Hotel clean and friendly, good food,"
"The Westin Peachtree was a delight to stay in, Friendly, helpful, clean and comfortable. I ordered food and it arrived hot and delicious and plenty. No complaints, and would very happily stay here again."
"Stayed here for work close to the airport for our ""Infamous"" 2017 Winter Storm. The hotel is in a great location and in great condition, practically brand new. Everything was clean and convenient and the staff was wonderful."
"Love this hotel. Would stay no where else. It is convenient to everything in the downtown area. Staff was great but special s/o to Alonzo (the driver), Alicia (front desk) and Jamel (welcome ambassador)."
"We value your comments and suggestions, I wish I could re-do the entrance to our parking garage as well. Thanks for traveling and we welcome you back anytime."
"Awesome mini apartments, awesome staff, awesome location! This place has a full kitchen, so you can save money and eat healthier by going to the grocery store vs eating out. Pool a patio amazing, clean. The use of full BBQ.  Great place to stay."
"From the time you arrive, staff is friendly, very fast check in.  Room was very clean and beds are super soft.  The Happy Hour was fantastic and the breakfast was excellent.  The entire stay was amazing.  Very nice.  Excellent all around."
We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us!
"We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us during your convention, and that you were able to experience Polaris. We're very proud of our Blue Dome! Thx. so much for being our guest. Please come back again, soon!"
"Stayed in the Omni Hotel for business and was very pleased with the service, the cleanliness and overall appearance.  The Convention Center was on location so  it was quick to get to and from there. My room felt like home.  I would definitely stay again!."
"Wonderful hotel in general.I would recommend this hotel to any one. They are also one of the only Country Inn & Suites, which IÃ¢ÂÂve stayed at, that has a Ã¢ÂÂHappy DaysÃ¢ÂÂ. The breakfast was delicious, easy drive to the airport"
This hotel was in a great location and I enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and cocktail reception.  I was able to walk to the malls and there was a complimentary shuttle to nearby attractions. Nice stay and good service.
"I was attending a conference at this hotel. Excellent service, very helpful staff, and very nice meeting rooms and arrangements. Parking: Park in underground garage and pay at the counter near reception counter."
"Nice place to stay, clean room, clean bathroom, clean fitness. Unfortunately the swimming pool was to dirty to get in... maybe due to the bad weather. Maybe a little bit too expensive. Still a good place, i recommend it."
I would recommend people to visit the hotel. The experience was great. The food and drinks was good. Very friendly atmosphere. If you haven't been here recommend you to come. I would come back again. I enjoyed myself to the fullest.
"Overall the W was a pretty solid hotel. The pool area was pretty cool, but small. What stood out the most though was the service, especially David-Michael Searcy. Staff was great from start to finish."
This hotel was great...nice and clean. Customer service was great as well. This is our go to hotel from now on. The bed we had was dented in the middle but it worked out.
"This hotel is the best of the best! Excellent service, convenient location to the mall and other downtown entertainment. The hotel staff was very warm and welcoming. They go out your way to make your stay perfect! We will definitely return for another visit."
"Bed was hard and could not sleep 
Small bathtub 
No night restaurant except bar with only sandwiches 
Housekeeping was nonexistent 
Will never stay there again
Overpriced room service and valet 
Will never stay there again. Cheap but bad. Had a suite"
Hotel was not noted as under construction and it was a mess. The hotel was very noisy and the room ac was also. The staff was nice but I would suggest another hotel until this renovation is finished.  Location is ok but not great
"Thx. so much for being our guest! We're so glad you and your friends enjoyed your stay with us, and our great downtown neighborhood. And  please do come back for a couples weekend! We'd love to have you!"
"I reviewed this wonderful hotel but forgot to mention that there are NO microwaves in the room.  Makes it a little hard if you plan to stay several days. Also, I missed the Bell Captains.  That was such a great service the hotel once had."
Wow - what great comments!  Thank you so much!  I agree - our valet team are the best!  I'm so glad you enjoyed your time here in the city - come see us again soon!
"Great friendly staff. About a 5 minute walk to Georgia Aquarium,  Olympic park, and Coka Cola museum. Hotel has indoor and outdoor pool. We swam in both. Restaurants attached and within walking distance from hotel. Overall great staff and accommodations."
"Excellent hotel, great location and perfect for the AJC Peachtree Road Race.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Access to various Atlanta locations is perfect.  Very close to Marta which was a plus."
"The hotel staff was great at checkin, the room very nice clean and comfortable, looks like it had been recently remodeled. Bartender was very friendly and spot on recommending the chicken wings. I'll stay here again and recommend it.

"Hotel is clean, modern, and well decorated. My wife and I were attending for DragonCon. My wife and I appreciated the size of the suite and the quality of the hot breakfast provided. The hotel is easy walking distance from the MARTA."
The food and the atmosphere were fantastic...Perfect place for a work convention. I was here for a week and it felt like home. Everything went smooth and the staff were very personable and accommodating.
Stayed at this hotel on a recent business trip to Atlanta. Staff service was very good. Rooms large and new/clean. Location was close to restaurants and shopping in Buckhead area. Will definitely stay there again.
The breakfast was great! A good way to start your day and reduces cost of buying meals! A good location close to everything and lyft rides were quick and reasonable. Overall great value!
My overall experience was great at the Hyatt Regency in Atlanta however the elevators were a bit slow 3 out of 8 occasions and there were 2 out of 3 times that I had a difficult time getting in contact with the front desk.
We are happy we chose the Four Seasons Midtown Atlanta for Christmas Eve. The staff was friendly and efficient.  The room was immaculate and comfortable.  We had a stunning view of Atlanta's beautiful skyline.
"From the first phone call to the checkout, Jasmine was the epitome of professional and sweet.  The hotel was also hosting a wedding and a basketball tournament group, but you could not tell; it was neat, tidy and surprisingly quiet."
"Loved the location near to the shopping area. in the business district Buckhead. het hotel was fantastic and servie oriented. The wiskey bar was an interesting event on Friday and Saturday, where everyone was dressing up and looked really fancy."
"The room was big a clean, nice bed and also a pull out couch for extra guest was also available. Hot breakfast was great except I don't like oatmeal served on one a my days but overall excellent choices"
This DoubleTree Hotel is located in a pretty sketchy part of town.  Walking to and from hotel to restaurants required you to have your head on a swivel. Internet was slow. Bed was short sheeted. Staff was nice.
Thx. so much for your comments. We've shared them with our managers. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Please come back and stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead!
Really terrible hotel. I travel every week and will always avoid Hyatt properties if itÃ¢ÂÂs and option.  Clean your rooms with something besides an old dirty mop.  Pathetic.  Nothing worse than feeling disgusted in your room.
Had a very nice stay this weekend. Early checkin was accommodated. Especially appreciated call from Sharmayne notifying me of its availability and also Jaylens helpful hints during our shuttle ride to and from the mail. All were very courteous.
We stayed here to crash out for one night after our transatlantic flight. It was ok - comfortable bed in a reasonable size room. Breakfast was not included and the non-cooked buffet was adequate - the cooked buffet didn't appeal.
"This hotel is great. The hotel has been redone and is beautiful....love the look. The hotel staff is very nice, friendly,  and helpful. The room is clean and has a great mattress and bed linens, fluffy towels, and many pillows on the bed!"
"The entire staff was attentive and friendly.  The rooms were clean and had great decor. The Ellis is convenient to city transit, and a short walk to Centennial Olympic park, Phillips Arena and great restaurants. I will definitely stay here again in the future!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed my brief stay at this hotel.  The room was lovely. From the 18th floor, my view was exceptional.  Our conference went very smoothly and was a joy to attend.  Would love to come back some time!"
The user experience for internet connection is great. No necessity of passwords or IT people helping you to get connected. Great attention of Miss Tasha and Miss Amber. The shuttle service is good.  Employees are very kind.
"All in all rather plain experience though the bed was extremely comfortable.   I hope you change your policy re: Breakfast  I imagine I'm not the only one who is put off by ""Only coffee is complimentary policy."""
Best seafood restaurant best breakfast staff very nice and the front desk Mr Rowe was very friendly and he definitely make us feel welcomed he gave us everything we needed not that there was any complaints
Excellent value.   Will return to this hotel or the Hampton in within 2 months (my next visit). The hotel has a good value breakfast. I would expect more fruits and specifically vegetables or salad maybe.  The buffet was really nice with everything fresh. Thank you.
"The staff is Wonderful and try the breakfast sandwich, the best Ever! The rooms were clean but missing our Ellis pillows on the bed!  Again, location and service make it The place to stay in Atlanta- hope to be back next year!"
The staff is really friendly and the rooms are very contemporary. Great location and is near a lot of restaurants. The only problem is no room service and they do not serve any adult beverages in the hotel. Parking is valet.
Awesome beautiful hotel.  stayed there cause i wanted to jump on the tram to the hotel which is just a half block walk from the front door.  pricey but really nice. very clean and the welcome at the front desk was awesome
"Maids clearly make beds, that's it.  Every surface in my room had filth - gross stains on doors, garbage cans, floors, windows/sills. Restaurant area too - staff sitting around among tables with food all over them. Staff not up to Marriott standards."
"Location was perfect, service was excellent...great value for great service.
The bar was exactly what we needed at the end of the day, the bowling alley was a blast and the dinner at the Houston Mills House was phenomenal."
I stayed at this hotel for one day before moving into my apartment and I have to say it was clean the beds were comfortableÃ¢ÂÂ¦.but didn't like that there wasn't free wifi other than that I was satisfied for my one night stay
"The Grand Hyatt was absolutely excellent. The price was extremely reasonable for a suite, and the staff made our stay easy, convenient and welcoming. We will absolutely return on our next trip to The Buckhead area"
This is a really pretty hotel; good location for walking to Fox Theatre and Midtown Atlanta restaurants.  The staff was helpful in providing directions for dinner.  The expensive parking was my only complaint.
"This was our first time staying at a St. Regis property, but it will not be our last.  So lovely.  Very comfortable rooms.  Impeccable service.  Luxurious.  We had a short stay, less than 24 hours, but wish we had more time."
"Delta cancelled my flight Michelle checked me in, Belinda, and Alana they all made my day better. Friendly, helpful, quick responses. Will I stay again? Absolutely. Their service is great and the food was wonderful."
"Love the new renovations to this hotel very warm and welcoming environment! The suites are clean and nicely furnished,the staff is friendly and the breakfast is five star. First time staying was New Years Eve but I will be returning!"
"Very nice hotel in a great area of Atlanta.  It is great place to stay whether for business or pleasure. Staff was very helpful. Good location, across from shopping mall with many places to eat close by."
"Very nice hotel.  Valet parking is available, but is very costly so be warned.  I would say not to do valet, in that, you can walk to many of the places so save your money.  The hotel condition and lobby is very nice!"
We were there for a concert at Cobb Energy Center. Great location. We were able to walk to concert. Great service. We had someone from hotel pick us up from concert. We enjoyed our quick trip very much!
We had a great experience and stay at this hotel during a work trip to Atlanta. Taylor at the front desk was friendly and helpful from the moment we checked in. The lobby and meeting spaces are newly updated as well!
What great comments!  Thank you so much and we're very glad that we were able to be a part of the special event. Come see us again soon!
"Just a quick Thank You to the early morning staff, especially Billy of the Engineering Dept. A difficult morning became much easier with his assistance. 
  Stay was overall excellent, as expected of the Renaissance brand."
Thx. so much for your review. We've passed your comments on to our team. We apologize for any inconvenience during your stay. We hope you'll come back and stay with us again!
We have stayed here several times when we come to Atlanta for business/fun! What  a great value in the heart of Sandy Springs! The furnishings are a little dated but I love the value!
"I travel to Atlanta for work regularly and have stayed here several times.  The location is great, service is good, and the restaurant and bar are relaxing and nice.  The best part is the rooftop bar with views of the city.  Good value."
Beautiful hotel with great service. Stayed for 3 nights on business trip and would love to go back on a leisure trip. Hotel has everything you need from spacious rooms and most importantly a awesome staff.
This place is very close to everything you could want in Atlanta. The staff was extremely accomadating and treated me much more special than I am! My room was very and clean and the entire hotel is very well kept.
"Pros - great location and a friendly helpful staff, the wifi service is good and the bar area is fine. Nicely decorated. 
Cons - the rooms are small and the bathroom was tiny. Also no fridge in the room or ice machines on the floors."
"Surprised my wife for her birthday at the Glenn Hotel's rooftop lounge. Right in the heart of downtown Atlanta, Georgia, this beautiful hotel offers a great view of the city skyline, especially from the rooftop lounge. Absolutely, amazing!"
I was visiting on business and very impressed by the beautiful facilities and amazing service! I will definitely stay here again. I love the southern hospitality and beautiful surroundings. Thanks for a wonderful visit!
"This is the best place to stay in the Buckhead area! The shuttle, valet, local malls and ALL of the other amenities were perfect for any traveler!! The staff was professional, courteous and accommodating to ALL of my needs."
The Marriott is clean and well kept.  My room was quiet and comfortable.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  I would recommend this hotel if you have business in this part of Atlanta.  Great area around the Hotel to walk and get some exercise.
"Thx. so much for your review. So glad you enjoyed your stay during your conference. We're sorry to hear your room experience was not completely to your linking. We've passed your comments on to our team. We hope you'll stay with us again, soon!"
"WeÃ¢ÂÂve stayed at this location several times. ItÃ¢ÂÂs very attractive and convenient to restaurants, concert venues, and more. The hotel is well decorated, clean, and quiet. The staff members are very friendly and helpful."
Location was very good for the meetings we had there.  Hotel staff was very friendly.  Tyler checked me in and out and was great both times.  Many tourist activities are within the three mile range that the hotel car will take you for free.
"Spent three days for a conference and meetings. Service was very good. The food was excellent for a group of 150. I also used the gym, not huge but adequate. The lobby staff was very attentive and friendly."
Building is beautiful center where convention area food is very good service is very good room is clean and roof to restaurant 72 floor good food prices and views street Taxi outside the hotel not recomsnded
"Very satisfied with short stay here. Had great fitness center, clean rooms, and nice hot tub/pool area. Was a little disappointed with price of breakfast, because use to a complimentary breakfast, but overall very pleased with stay."
"The W downtown is a Beautiful hotel.  The lounge is stunning.  Hotel staff, guests services and Alonzo were fabulous; interested in my group, and set up free chair massages for guests.  Very attentive to our group.  Sleeping rooms were available for early check-in."
"Friendly staff, clean & spacious rooms. Nice lobby area and pretty location. Check in was quick! The bathroom was small and had no towel racks so it was hard to reuse. Pool towels were tiny and rough."
"This is a very lovely hotel, ideally suited for business travelers.  We found the staff to be extremely hospitable and helpful.  The in-and-out valet/cab/uber is a bit of a challenge to keep the cars moving, but overall well-handled."
"This is an old style Marriott that has been updated. The rooms feel old and the concierge lounge can get quite cramped, but is perfectly adequate. Nothing memorable, but a decent place that meets Marriott standards."
This hotel is enormous and simply spectacular. I attended s day long training here and was served two meals.  I was completely impressed with the kindness of the staff and the quality (and display) of the food.
"Great bed, wifi, shower, and location. Complimentary breakfast or snacks would have been nice but it was not the end of the world. Staff was nice and helpful. We could walk to all the major attractions."
"Hotel room door locking system did not work and caused major delays in getting back into my room after leaving.  Not only did this cause me to be late for my meeting I traveled for, but also was a security concern."
Everyone in there needs customer service training. Would advice people to avoid this place. Only Omar in breakfast area gave good service to our entire group. Hope the management really pays attention to the reviews.
"The customer service here is just wonderful.  Everyone from the front desk, restaurant to housekeeping.  All nice clean and easily accessible. I'll be back."
"We came to Atlanta to celebrate my sons birthday everyone at this hotel are fantastic showing us to our room carrying our luggage and breakfast every morning was always welcomed by you staff with a great smile
We will be back"
This property's only benefit is the location. The hotel itself doesn't come close to being a nice hotel. The staff are young people that can't provide basic guest services correctly. Bartender was late just not a relaxing hotel.
This was a great venue to host our conference.  The staff was very helpful.  They provide a whole team to assist during your stay.  Everyone was very professional and courteous.  Great location and the views of the city are incredible.
"The hotel needs some significant upgrading as it is in disrepair.  Rooms were clean and staff was very engaging, but attention needs to be given to the physical plant.  Had outlet covers in our room missing and tile coming off the shower wall..  Dated!"
Stayed at this location several times.   Good location and clean but the staff seem to be there until they find another job.   Not the usual check-in friendliness (after waiting for someone to show) and was dressed with a t-shirt and hoodie.
"Great place to stay to meet up with the Family.,all good will be back,Staff Great ,Room was Great and Location Good ,Quiet but Good people who stayed in the Hotel which make you feel secure Security people all way watching."
"The widest Sheraton I have seen in my life!!!
One elevator is not working, so they directed the customers to the service elevator. The way to the service elevator is discussing!! This hotel should not be rated even with 1 star!!"
"Visited this hotel again nearly 4 years later and still had a great experience but the suites are really showing wear and are in need of a cosmetic update. Overall a good experience though with ultra helpful staff, in particular the butlers."
The room was well appointed on the clean wellness floor. the staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel was more reasonable in cost compared to nearby hotels when I booked. I booked it for my next trip too!
"Great hotel, fantastic stay.  Checked out on Dec. 26, about 12 noon, from room 1838. 
 Check out lady behind desk , approximately 5' 7"", rather surly, but for that, perfect stay.   Restaurant staff great.  Recommended."
"Within walking distance of Georgia World Congress Center and several nearby restaurants.  The breakfast is good, but expensive if not a diamond member.  The exercise facility is stocked well.  The USA Today newspaper is offered."
"I attended a business meeting and our group was huge- the service was very nice and friendly but the elevator service was a disaster- having over 70 people and the elevators not working was not pleasant.
Bar and food service was excellent."
This hotel will do great with the new stadium being built behind it. Great location and the inside is Beautiful! The rooms are very nice. Will definitely stay there again. The cookies were delicious!!
the staff was very welcoming and helpful. They offered to drive my husband to the post office to mail some letters. The location is close to the Marta and a lot of great restaurants. I would stay there again
"We have stayed at this property about 6 times in the last few years. It's always great, clean, good food and a great staff! we will be back in December."
This is a great hotel with a great staff.  They do their best to be professional and treat guests with respect.  This is the second or third time I have stayed at this location and each visit has been outstanding.
This was a perfect place to stay for our first days in the Atlanta area.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms were comfortable and clean.  Made driving in to see sites close to downtown fast and easy.
"Wonderful experience near many food options. The entire experience made me appreciate how much Hyatt has put into its brand over the past few years.  I entered the Marriott next door, it looked fine, but heard it was tired looking in the rooms."
The hotel is in a great location. The only downside I had was the mandatory valet which causes checkout wait to take awhile.was able to walk and eat breakfast at the Silver Skillet Grill which was recommended to by Atlanta family I have.
"We've stayed here several times and have been relatively pleased with the experience. But the property is slowly deteriorating. The entire property needs to be updated - rooms, landscape, common areas, restaurant, etc. It has a lot of potential. Unfortunate."
The service is on half-speed. No self parking close by. Beds are worn. Fitness center is sparse. Restaurant and bar seem to lack atmosphere. But price is decent for Buckhead. Breakfast bar is very good. Walking distance to good restaurants and shopping.
"Very clean nice rooms, staff is excellent.  The breakfast and supper are above average for included meals.  If you take advantage of both this is an excellent value. The airport shuttle also works very well."
My stay was short but very nice. My room was ready at 1:30 pm which was great!  I had a good lunch in the restaurant.  It was raining and the staff was very helpful during that time with transportation.
This trip was excellent location was great you could walk to everything. The kids loved centennial park. Great vacation. The service and the staff was excellent. Good breakfast buffet. The room was spacious and clean.  Would definitely recommend this hotel and trip for families!
"Very nice, new hotel.  Bar served decent cocktails and you can easily walk to the aquarium and to many restaurants/bars.  Stopped here for a night on the drive from Detroit to Orlando.  Would definitely stay here again."
A good overnight stop.  Exceptional receptionist help in resolving a room issue.  Breakfast fine.  Convenient for Cumberland Mall.  Nice free welcome cookies at reception.  Good position for onward travel further north.
Quiet rooms & very helpful staff.  $70 for breakfast for two people was clearly a silly price.  Main complaint was a/c was not working properly for entire hotel -- were not warned of this when checking in.
"Stayed here one night and the hotel was fine.  Staff were all friendly and efficient.  Check-in and Check out were quick and valet parking was fine as well.  Rooms were standard, nothing special but had everything you could need for a hotel."
"One of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. The butler service can handle anything you throw at them. During the holidays they have an ice rink, but the price was way too high. The TV behind the bathroom mirror is a neat touch."
It was a great first time experience for me and my mother.  The room and staff were the best.  We will return to visit the are in the very near future and we'll make plans to stay at the Hyatt House during our visit.
Close to braves stadium. Free parking free WiFi safe secure indoor rooms. Clean neat. Nice comfortable stay at a great price . Close to many restaurants and shopping. Close to interstate 75 . Indoor pool.
We had a great stay and loved the extra attention that John Apostolo gave us in your restaurant. It was the icing on the cake. Also Antoinette  the bar tender was great as well. Thanks we will be back! George Butchikas
"Room Service, Room Service, Room Service. We enjoyed breathtaking views of the Atlanta skyline while drinking Champagne. We explore the city, and there are several restaurants within walking distance from  Loews. We enjoyed our in room dining and spa amenities at Loews Atlanta."
Front desk employees never smile or attempt to give you a good service. Hotel is noisy and not clean. Rooms don't have a fridge or microwave. I was very disappointed with the service and will not stay at a Double tree ever again!
"No concierge room.  No coffee/tea etc in room.  No extra bath amenities like mouth wash, more bottled water available. Rediculous to have to go to the fitness room for coffee/tea/water. Very little seating in the lobby."
"From the minute you walk in, until you leave you are treated like royalty. The front desk people are the best. They go out of their way to make you feel special. So professional. Pool great, Rooms are beautiful and spotless"
"The hotel was very clean, was cool (some hotels are hot in the halls and lobbies), smelled nice, the staff was incredibly professional and friendly.  They definitely aimed to please. I very much enjoyed my stay and will be back to this hotel again."
We were very impressed with the quality of service and cleanliness of facilities. Definitely recommend valet service! With walking distance to many restaurants and places to do things!! we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Very comfortable.
"I stayed at this hotel for three nights on business, it is a big hotel, with the atrium set-up it can be noisy at night.

The room was spacious and very clean.

Customer service was excellent from the concierge, breakfast, bar & the lovely driver."
"Excellent service..Great staff that was very professional and courteous. Never heard of this hotel,but had to find a place due to cancelled flight. Nice spacious room. It was quiet.!!  That's a rarity these days. Again stay here.!  Right next to piedmont park and Marta train."
"This hotel is very nice. Rooms are clean and bed and bedding are luxurious. Staff is excellent, especially Jamilah and Steve, who made my stay especially comfortable. I enjoyed the location, which is close to shopping and restaurants."
It was a good value but don't expect anything over the top. Service was ok at check in. My room was quiet but felt old.  Was very happy with the gym and the lobby. Would stay again if looking for value instead of luxury.
The staff was very nice and helpful!  Went to a concert at SunTrust park.  They offer a free shuddle service.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  The breakfast spread was delicious!  Cook to order omelets.
Overall it was a nice stay at Sonesta. Would prefer to stay again if at all I get a chance. All the amenities provided are working properly and I get more than what I anticipated in my stay at Sonesta. Thank you.

"I was blown away by the decor and level of service received on my trip to Buckhead. Everyone from the front desk to the General Manager, Matt Parsons is dynamite. If you are a business traveler I highly recommend this hotel."
"Great check-in experience. Very pretty, comfortable and modern room. Very friendly and helpful staff. Wonderful location - right next to 2 malls and a free shuttle service. I was very happy with my stay."
"Amenties are good
the quality of service is poor (lights not checked in room, a toilet unuseable) in the morning all the employee take breakfast with customers without taking care of guests
the rooms are great"
Bed was hard and had a body impression in it that was so deep I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt just roll out of it that I actually had to get out the bed and get in on the other side. Hotel would not allow a late check out.
We have stayed at this hotel many many times and have always had a great experience. Today we were greeted by Latoya who made sure our check in was extra fun with drinks and homemade key lime pie!Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã°ÂÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¨
"Excellent location, great gym, clean and comfortable rooms. Staff friendly and helpful. Room service is good and reasonably priced, market has a good selection of drinks and snacks.  Will return when in ATL for work."
Beautiful hotel. Excellent service and staff. Loved staying here. Everyone was helpful and friendly. Staff would approach you if they thought you needed assistance. I rarely had to ask for anything. Great experience.
The stay was really good. But the breakfast was not included in stay. And also the shuttle was not working when we needed the most. Also they could have arranged for some chairs in the lobby since construction was going on
"Nice atmosphere. Clean room. Quiet and convenient. There were a few weddings and receptions going on, as well as a dance convention. The employees were very helpful and accommodating. Every time I had a question I could quickly spot an employee willing to help."
"Decent rooms, decent meals, decent gym.
Ok value.  Room was clean. I hate that housekeeping leaves all dishes, glasses, silverware, coffee pot etc in the dishwasher every time, every room, every floor. I've stayed more than 5 X ."
"The staff were extremely courteous and very friendly. I've never felt more at home and welcome. The room was great and the hotel overall was extremely clean. The next time I visit the Atlanta area, I'll be booking my room here."
Excellent hotel with outstanding staff. Will definitely stay there again. Food was good and the lounge was great for fellowship with friends. We truly enjoyed our stay and will reccomend this location to friends.
Embassy Suites ATL was the best hotel experience I have had in a long time. This hotel is absolutely beautiful and the room is so nice and spacious.. OMG and the staff amazing!!! I would never stay anywhere else in Atlanta.
"Had a great experience here! Fantastic location with a beautiful park close by. Very convenient to lots of sports attractions and a fantastic museum on Civil Rights. The people working at the hotel were very friendly, professional, and helpful."
"It was a clean place to stay, used the digital reservation and digital check in. Valet was a bit pricey but it's Atlanta..... Close to Lenox Mall..... Bar is not stocked very well.....it's a good place to lay your head down and rest"
"Great view, hotel room was clean and staff friendly.  I would recommend this location for anyone visiting Atlanta. Staff gave some great recommendations for shopping.  Not sure with this location where you would park if you didn't valet.  The valet service was okay."
"Amazing room and views!  Stayed in one of the penthouse suites, which had a very large outside patio.  The staff was very courteous, helpful and friendly.  Would stay here again and definitely recommend this hotel!"
"Front desk clerk Ms.AC was Great, she was very friendly, pleasant and helpful. Ms.AC made attempts to over turn my bad experience. The rooms and front desk staff was great but the shuddle service sucks"
The hotel was very clean and within a mile of some wonderful restaurants. The staff was very accommodating and the bar was a welcome stop after dinner for a nightcap. Two thumbs up from someone who travels 90% of the time!!
We were there for a wedding. Great location. Friendly staff and the lounge area was perfect for a gathering spot! Spacious room with great beds. Plenty of towels and products available. Great restaurants in house and nearby.
"Clean room, comfortable, centrally located and easy to park. Perfect for a quick getaway. Staff was courteous and very helpful. Great for a couple or couple with young children. I would stay here again!"
Great location; great facility; great value.  I received everything I wanted in my brief stay this trip.  The staff welcomed me warmly and quickly when I checked in.  The quality of the room was great.  The staff in the breakfast bar were outstanding.
Our family thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Hyatt House. Friendly staff. Comfy beds.  Loved the pillows. Slept like we were home.  Quiet compared to most hotels we have visited. Valet parking is a bit steep.  Good location to area attractions.
Shuttle drivers are phenomenal--especially  Anna....always friendly and professional. I never have an issue waiting to be picked up by any of tge drivers. 1000stars. This is always my goto place when staying in Atlanta.
"Great service, nicely priced and I recommend the suite hands down! Right off 75 N/S so very fast commute to anywhere in city. Nice hotel, breakfast and overall I would stay here anytime while in Atlanta."
Awesome place to stay!!  I would stay again my kids love this hotel!! I would recommend anyone to stay here.  The lobby and breakfast area were very clean and the staff was friendly. The room was very clean and was ready when we arrived.
Needed a place to stay close to the airport for a layover on our way from St Lucia to Seattle. this place made for a comfortable rest stop. My wife and I were able to get very nice late night dinner (10:30 PM).
"Staff was professional and friendly, accomodations were excellent as well as the service, food and exercise/spa facilities. Location of the hotel to restaurants were great, the staff greeted you each time they saw a customer, would recommend this hotel, 5 star experience"
The facility is very nice with plenty of room in the breakfast area.  The staff was friendly and professional.  The room was clean and well maintained.  Very little noise.  Would gladly return to this hotel in a future trip.
Talking my teenager to Science Camp at Emory University. This was a good choice for day before for shopping & good restaurants!  Staff was extremely professional & friendly. Lenox Mall across the street. Rooms we very comfortable & quiet. Will definitely stay again
My wife and I stayed at the Westin for our first visit to Atlanta. It exceeded all expectations. The service was exceptional. ItÃ¢ÂÂs definitely on our list for a repeat visit.  The bell hops and valet servers were especially friendly and helpful.
"Large, spacious suites perfect for a couple's in-town getaway. Romance her for a night away from the stress of everyday life. Close to midtown theatres, clubs, etc for an evening of fine dining & entertainment."
This hotel has all of the amenities. The entire hotel is very modern and tastefully decorated. They offer a free breakfast and happy hour which included food. The service was the best I had ever experienced. I am very pleasantly surprised. Great place!
This hotel is located in the midtown area and made touring the city very easy.  We got by with walking and/or taking uber or Marta train to get around. Well maintained hotel with superb staff.  You won't be sorry.
"The room was very quite, clean and up-to-date.  The staff was friendly and multi-tasked.  Food choices are somewhat limited and not many healthy options either but what I did order was tasty.  Like most hotels, food, drinks, and movie rentals are costly."
"The WIFI was great and fast, the building has an interesting history, recommend reading the information in the lobby. The staff exemplified southern hospitality. Bathroom was a little small but I don't spend a lot of time in there :-)"
"The hotel was beautiful and so clean! The staff member that checked us in was extremely courteous! I booked the room last minute, so I was very surprised by the size of the room and the trendy accommodations. 10/10 would recommend!"
"We came to Atlanta from Canada to celebrate our anniversary. The staff and accommodations were absolutely wonderful and we did not have one complaint. Wish we could have stayed longer, incredible experience and would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to return"
"Rooms clean and service friendly.  Beds comfortable and supportive.  Had our shower drained better, I could have let my toddler take a shower, but I'm sure this is not an issue in every room.  Enjoyed not having to pay downtown Atlanta prices, yet being close."
We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Staff was exceptional! Room was clean and well cared for. Food was great! We will return to this hotel on our next visit to Atlanta. We love Hyatt and this one did not disappoint.
"I got upgraded to the Presidential Suite for being guest of the day even though I am a Silver member.

The staff is very friendly, good breakfast, nice stay.  I wish they had HD channels, even though they have HDTVs, but the staff is great."
"Good service, nice views and conveniently located near restaurants and public transportation. 

Their pillows are relatively large and hard.  Not a major issue, but they could provide better softer options when asked."
"In the heart of business town buckhead, this is a good choice for stay. Rightly priced, decent breakfast and all amenities make this place worth visiting. Staff is very helping and best part is their shuttle service."
"Other than the room smelling like smoke and the receptionist being dry and unconcerned, oh wait the breakfast wasn't too good,, but it was roomy, comfortable, and view quiet. Nice property and in a great area!! Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ"
Great Location! Extremely Friendly Staff! Very comfortable beds! This hotel had a shuttle service that was awesome. Drivers took you to all the great shopping and wonderful restaurants in the area. I highley recommend Grand Hyatt Atlanta in Buckhead!!
"Staff is really nice. Hotel is good. The rooms are excellent. You have everything you need there.
Complimentary Breakfast is really good for US hotels standard. Location is great.
I would recommend this hotel for sure."
"One of the top hotels in Buckhead, great staff, great rooms, great rates. The hotel is very convenient to almost everything in Atlanta and Buckhead. I would highly recommend looking into The Grand Hyatt Buckhead."
The hotel was amazing and the staff was amazing all the way from the front desk staffTayrell and Chad were fantastic .The housekeeping and van service were amazing .Definitely a jewel of Atlanta .Comfortable and amazing with a great restaurant
"I just returned from Atlanta for work and would recommend this hotel. The hotel was very clean, service was excellent, everyone was very friendly and accommodating. Location was convenient to everything. Gym is great. Breakfast is great as well."
Blade show. The bigger knives show in the world! Great organization. Top knives and supply. You can buy all materials knives tools outdoor and military materials and supply for knifemaking. Meet best knifemaker.
"the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the temperature was just right, the desk chair was comfortable and everything was clean.  A great bargain with breakfast and internet included (a special deal for my company), but a great deal nonetheless."
"The lobby was beautiful, we had an informal social on the last day that was really nice. The friendly staff was all smalls all throughout the day, and the beautiful spacious rooms...wow! The complimentary coffee near the restaurant was a daily lifesaver!"
"I would recommend this hotel. After checking into the hotel and the little drama that I received, I really got more than I was expecting.  Great place for family of four.  Family of 5 will not fit these rooms.  staff was very nice."
Enjoyed the stay. No mixer due to holiday.quiet and peaceful.i would recommend this site to family and friends. Was easy to access I -75 .commode was slow to flush. Will try it again in the near future.
This is my go to hotel for this type of trip. Good value and location. We had a couple of issues with our room and they we promptly remedied. Breakfast buffet was very good with variety. Convenient parking and restaurants.
Omni North Tower - I had a wonderful view of the park the staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and the bed was ready comfortable. It is great business trip will come back and stay again.
"The entire hotel woke up to cold showers one morning. The staff seemed indifferent to it; of course they probably had a warm shower in their homes.
The breakfast I had on campus was greasy, over cooked and not very good. Very disappointing."
Be prepared to pay for parking! Air wasn't working so our stay in the room was very uncomfortable!! Staff said it was fixed.... it wasn't! Staff did however offered a fan.  Great breakfast! Wasn't a fan of happy hour
I had the displeasure of picking this hotel...pictures are old..rooms are small..and mine was dirty...the second room the bathroom was dirty....way overpriced for such garbage....I will pass this one over the next time I stay in Atlanta.
"Overall an excellent Quality, a true 5 Star Hotel.
The Spa is one of the best in the city. the staff is very helpful and welcoming. The location is great and easily accessible. ideal for Business or Leisure."
"Hotel is located on one of the busiest districts in Atlanta and from the 18th floor you hear every siren, screech, engine rev and base bear in full HD surround sound that single pane glass has to offer."
"Location and service exceeded all of our expectations as a working group.  Every one of our Marines was treated with courtesy and care.  Awesome reception by the staff, great concern by the restaurant service, exceptional facilities to stay.  I WILL BE BACK!"
"Not our 1st  stay at this hotel, as before staff is top notch and hotel is has met all expectations since it's recent renovations."
"I stayed at this hotel for a work conference. The staff were all excellent, and any issues were addressed immediately and graciously.  The food was good, and location was great.  Easy 4 block walk from the train and easy walk to major sites."
"Hotel staff was super friendly, rooms were clean and well appointed and the location was surrounded by great places to eat. Really enjoyed my stay and will stay at this hotel whenever I am in Atlanta."
Enjoy staying here during Christmas time. Convenient to both Lenox Mall and also Phipps plaza. Breakfast is good as well as their room service option. Hotel is clean. Valet parking.  The suite is perfect if you are traveling with children
Great location next to the convention Center.  Rooms are spacious.  Facility is clean and well maintained.  Indoor/outdoor pool.  Fun bar with happy hour specials. Concierge club had a lovely view. Staff was excellent.
"The greeting was very well, the staff was very friendly, went overboard to help and serve me. I love the drinks. I love the wyxz bar and concept. The pool is very relaxing and well kept. I will stay there again, and recommend friends."
A stay at Wyndham is always a pleasure.  Staff bend over backward to make your time with them pleasant.  Hot breakfast is great!
The staff here was very friendly and welcoming.  The hotel is convenient to all major roads. Tons of shopping and restaurants just minutes away.  The hotel restaurant is also really good.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.
The hotel is decorated beautifully. Loved the remodeled vintage look. Beds are comfortable. Shower pressure was amazing. Complimentary coffee in the lobby was great. Parking is overpriced ($38 valet only). I would definitely stay here again.
Some of the most welcoming & courteous staff you can find. The Studio bar has a solid selection and a good happy hour. Housekeeping knows how to get the job done without annoying you. Rooms are really large. I'll be back.
"The hotel site advertised free wine tasting and great views which we recieved neither. Was thinking of coming back to the same hotel, but I would probably shop around for a better option for the price I paid."
"Convenient downtown location, steps from light rail. Room small but clean and comfortable, bathroom very nice. Fitness room small but adequate. Staff friendly and helpful. Nothing spectacular about it, but it was very pleasant."
"We had a terrible stay. Of the four rooms we booked, three were bad. Broken tiles, broken lights, uncleaned rooms, front desk people who didn't care. Each time we complained, the front desk people seemed uninterested and tired of people complaining."
everything about the room and stay was perfect except the hide a bed couch.. had to call for linins and although they brought them quickly the linins were packed in a bag and were much less quality than the bed linins
Everyone was friendly and accommodating.  They accommodated me and my guest at the last minute due to some last minute changes and it really improved the quality of our stay and overall trip.  Sometimes it's the little things that makes a big difference!
"The front desk workers were so kind and always very helpful and the breakfast ladies did a wonderful job. One front desk worker, Brandon, answered all of my question about Atlanta and was very friendly."
The place was a dump. Dishes littered the halls all day for many days. Need to improve the cleanliness to be acceptable. Constantly having to avoid the land mines to get to our suite. Stayed 3 days/2 nights so wasn't just a one off.
Thx. so much for your review. We're so very sorry to hear that your room during your event was up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please accept our apologies. We hope you'll stay with us again.
"A pleasant suprise. Compared to others in this chain, rooms were particularly roomy, stylish and well-furnished.  Was very near where I had eetings, and also had good restaurants nearby. Recommeneded if you need to be in this area"
This was my first experience as a guest at a luxury hotel and I explained that upon check-in. Patrick assisted me and he made my stay remarkable! There was also Ms. Linda and Ms. Keela from the SpaÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¢ÂÂ¤
For a convenient hotel in the heart of Buckhead this one is great. Excellent access to main attractions and travel routes. Strongly recommend for a comfortable and quiet room. Banquet services are excellent with meal services handling large groups efficiently.
"Easy and safe walk to peachtree midtown restaurants. Very nice restaurant and bar area with outside seating. Attentive staff. Downside expensive valet parking only. Upside Ubers are readily accessible. 
CVS, Publix, restaurants all in walking distance."
"Experience was average. Shuttle service not satisfactory at all, rude and disrespectful drivers and never on time. Average customer service. Breakfast delicious and employers at the grill very friendly and helpful."
"Very spacy, clean rooms with new carpets and furniture. Good swimming pool. Good complementary breakfast. Good location, a lot of stores and restaurants around. Bathrooms are a bit small, but also very clean. Airy, nice smell, very quiet."
"In town for kickoff classic, so much going on in town made it difficult parking at the hotel convenient to our room & loading/unloading luggage.  Breakfast is always delicious. Staff is friendly. There is some minimal maintenance that needs attention."
"This is an excellent property to stay at. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable.  I would recommend this hotel, as I would also stay again.  The property is located in the perfect area for airport access and exploring the city."
"Amazing customer care; in particular Ms.Lynn from the Philippines .She is simply wonderful,humble and great finesse.Thank you so much for making this World more beautiful with your hearty serviceÃ¢ÂÂ£Ã¯Â¸Â
Hellen."
"With an attractive rate and an ideal location in the heart of Buckhead, what more could you ask for? We look forward to seeing you next time!"
The rate given to our family was not a good discount for the type of rooms that were made assessible. $140 A Night was insulting for a group of 50 or more. This hotel stay was no different for any others.
"Gigi was amazing! She ensured we were happy, our drinks filled, and conversation flowing. It was a great time. Gigi was so attentive and provided great restaurant recommendations. She's wonderful and makes great drinks! Had such a good time!"
"This hotel was nice, clean, new and had free shuttle back and forth all day to the anime convention! Beds slept well and I never heard my neighbors....that's rare. Great breakfast with fruits, Starbucks coffee and omelette station. I would book again for sure!"
"Everything was great about this hotel. It was in a perfect location that was close to everything we wanted to do. The room was clean, the staff was nice, the breakfast was filing. I have absolutely no complaints."
"Hadn't stayed at this property in many years, but was pleased to see the improvements and renovations since our last stay. Also, my departure was very smooth. I used the valet service and that really helped expedite things."
"This is a wonderful hotel. The staff is the very definition of Southern hospitality, always friendly, always helpful. Great location with a trolley to the Marta station. Good food in the restaurant. Would stay here again in a minute."
"Clean room, overpriced. Very little hot water. Very well located. Considerably overpriced in my opinion. Courteous staff, adequate breakfast overall an average experience but not a good value for the money."
"Great amenities.  Close to basketball arena, food court, shopping and park. Easy to find something to do.  I did not swim, but others that were there looked like they were having a great time.  Nice beds."
"Hairs in the bed, hairs on the towel, dirty tub, and old carpets. Old and tired. Great location and convenient for overnight airport stays. Courteous front desk staff and efficient shuttle service to the airport but management has to get the basics right."
"Hotel was close to the venue, great value, clean rooms, very nice breakfast, helpful staff, convenient to airport, shuttle ran on time.  Happy Hour reception had hot and cold appetizers to choose from. A great experience."
The room is descent.  My conference is here so better stay in the same hotel.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs quite surprisingly that there are not overwhelmed with attendees.  The hotel is quite convenient in the downtown area..
"This is a lovely hotel.  The staff are very kind and considerate.  It is in the heart of downtown Atlanta, close to everything.  There is a MARTA mass transit station next door which is very convenient to and from the airport."
I was at the hotel for a state conference.  There was no internet connection available.  The presenters also had problems with the connection.
"Flew in for our holiday and decided to stay over before picking up our hire car. Close to airport (10 mins in a cab) , good size rooms , good service, ideal for what we wanted. Concierge lounge has reasonable food offerings."
Overall stay was great.  Breakfast buffet was not what we expected.  Breakfast items were not available and staff tried their best to keep up with the crowd but due to renovations they expressed they didn't have a adequate kitchen.
Just finished an awesome meeting at the Artmore. The service at check in with April was amazing. She turned a little snafu into a pleasurable experience!  This is a small but perfect hotel. Close to Marta and many many walkable restaurants!
"Nice place to stay though we arrived on a rainy day; there is no shelter where you can unload without getting wet. Staff is friendly. 
The TVs in the rooms came on LOUD every time which is distressing."
"The location of this hotel is excellent. Very close to the Marta hub, and an easy walk to downtown. We were visiting for the Final Four and walked to and from the activities. Free breakfast and the staff was very accommodating."
"The Emory Conference Center is an oasis - beautiful decor in the midst of trees and green space yet close to Emory Point which has food and shopping. Our room was very comfortable and the staff we interacted with professional, courteous and nice!"
"Had a fantastic experience at the W! Great customer service, and Lance was awesome!! The rooms were spacious and very clean. Rooftop bar was great, and there was an impressive view of the Buckhead skyline!"
This location is near some of downtown's main attractions. The hotel itself was really nice. The front desk staff was friendly. It was convenient that the hotel had a snack bar. I would definitely stay here again.
I had a wonderful visit with the hotel. It was beautiful and the room was everything. I received wonderful customer service from April at the front desk. She was kind as well as intelligent. I appreciate all the service.
Hotel is close to expressway and has a grocery (Publix) and drug (CVS) store within walking distance.
Especially good if you are an aviation enthusiast. Get a room facing ATL and watch the worlds busiest airport operate from a nice patio outside your room. Rooms are very nice and the service has always been excellent when I've stayed here.
Didn't know it was 30 min away from downtown ....still says atlanta in title of hotel so that was a bummer
Tremendous value!  Very pleasant staff.  Great layout and functionality of weightroom and lounge areas!
@nd time staying at Emory center and it was wonderful great food exercise room very good and has an indoor pool that is great when need to relax. not to mention fire pit out front where friends can come visit sit and have a drink.
Nice lobby and decent restaurant but the rooms are sub-par. Paint peeling from ceiling in bathroom and stuffy rooms. Mediocre bed and below average bedding. TV has terrible picture and no PPV. I expected much more.
"Fantastic rooms, loved the sunken bathtub.  The pool area was beautiful, and the staff friendly and accommodating.  Would definitely recommend for any trip, though it is a bit far from the airport and other areas."
Found a great alternative to Hyatt Regency when staying in ATL.  The free parking was a great aspect and the complimentary breakfast was also an appeal.  I recommend this location to anyone looking to be in ATL for any reason.
"This Ritz Carlton is definitely not up to Ritz standards. Restaurant is more in line with a Holiday Inn. Food is below average. Hotel is changing name in 2018, watch for that!! Front desk staff not well trained, no personalization, no welcome."
My husband & I stayed at the Renaissance in Midtown Atlanta for our anniversary. It was perfect for a short getaway. The valet staff was friendly and quick as well as the front desk. I would enjoying staying here again.
"Very nice accommodations, Great staff, Good food. With cameras in all hallways there needs to be better noise control enforcement with youth. It would be nice if they had personnel dedicated to insuring a quiet and peaceful sleep for guests."
"We stayed there one night between flights. We enjoyed nice beds, fast free Internet and various breakfast. There is just noice coming from street and aircrafts,  which is understandable and it could be not nice for more days stay."
Hotel is gorgeous however is much to understaffed to able to provide a top notch experience. Housekeeping couldn't make rounds in time to bring towels before 1 pm and floor wasn't cleaned for two days
We sincerely apolgize that you had maintenance issues in your guestroom.  This is not typical of our  property.  Please contact me directly so that I may find and correct the issues that you have brought up. 770-953-8850
"Hotel staff was excellent, friendly and helpful.  Accommodations were great.  The hotel is easily accessible off I-75N just off I-285 in Atlanta.  Our room was neat and clean. We stayed there to go to an Atlanta Braves game."
"I always enjoy staying with Hyatt!!!!  The atmospher is nice, the staff is super helpful and rhe surroundings were emaculate!!!  The location of the downtown property is perfect for events downtown.  LOVE IT!!!"
Clean room! bed was great. People friendly. I could hear next door but overall I would recommend this hotel. Complimentary breakfast was oK. Starbucks was in the hotel so good coffee was available. Internet was slow. Complimentary evening beverages was nice.
Overall experience was good.  The only complaints are that the employees working the concierge desk were not very pleasant and housekeeping didn't do a proper job of checking room because someone else's clothing was left in the drawers.
Perfect for my business trip. Within walking distance to the Marta. Or the hotel shuttle will take you if its raining. Several good restaurants in walking distance.  Would definitely stay at this hotel again.
We loved staying at this hotel!!! They were amazing!! Robert Holliday and Chris were honestly the most helpful and pleasant ppl we met in atl. Definitely a must stay hotel!!! Tell them Olivia the birthday girl from la referred you  :)
"This property transports you in minutes from a city environment to a tranquil retreat. The hotel was good, the food was greater, and the staff was the greatest! The Emory Conference Center is ideal for  business and pleasure."
Stay away from this hotel. It is not only in need of DESPERATE RENOVATION it's also dirty and unsanitary. I can't wait to check out!!!!! Never again.  See pics below of the bathroom.  The bedroom furniture is old and dirty.......everything is bad. STAY AWAY!
"Although this isn't the newest hotel in the area, the staff made it a very nice place to stay. They were quick, friendly and attentive. Good value. I would stay again when I travel to the area. Nice hotel for the price."
"Our group of 6 visitors to Atlanta enjoyed a fantastic lunch on the balcony. It was a Beautiful setting and excellent service. Our server made great recommendations too. From our drinks to dessert, everything was fantastic."
Another great Westin hotel. Service was excellent. Great bar. Easy access from Marta. The service for our business meeting was outstanding. Breakfast was good but lunch was better. Healthy good choices for this.
"If ones doesn't need anything out of the ordinary it's fine, all smiles and good cheer, but if one needs special accommodations not at all helpful...even when corporate customer service got involved the hotel did not accommodate...will never be back"
This hotel is spacious since it is all Suites. The location is great and close to many Resturants both local and chains . They provide free breakfast and evening reception. It is much cheaper than the surrounding hotels next door and across the street
Very clean hotel. Check in was a breeze and lobby was very welcoming. Loved sitting on the outdoor balcony getting some fresh air after a long day of traveling.  Airport shuttle was great too!  Would stay at the hotel again!
"The amount of children in this hotel was overwhelming. Breakfast was a zoo. Hotel is nice. Staff was nice. No hair dryers in the room I was in, so waited 30 minutes for one. Definitely book for a family trip"
The front desk clerk put us into the wrong room and we had to wait 30 min. to get into another room.  Both the parking lot and sidewalk to our room was poorly lit and covered in trash from the housekeeping department.
"The room was clean and large with the kitchen area and the staff was friendly and helpful. Inside parking was also convenient and the staff was friendly and helpful. Best of all, the location was perfect for visiting all of Buckhead."
"Great location, wonderful staff that help you feel relaxed.  Rooms are decorated nicely and outlets are mid wall no crawling around under furniture looking for a plug. Has exercise room open 24/7. The evening gatherings include a lite dinner and drinks."
Great location and front desk. Valet is questionable as they have a very slim area to work and caused a little damage. Better places to stay I have to imagine for what you pay. Ok roomsbut loud AC and uncomfortable bed.
Was in Atlanta for a friendÃ¢ÂÂs wedding and the guests were lodged at The Eilis. Was right off of The MARTA line which was convenient and couldnÃ¢ÂÂt have asked for a nicer staff or cleaner and more comfy rooom. Would highly recommend this hotel.
"My family stayed on our way back from Florida, very friendly and kind staff.  The hotel was very clean and updated. The beds were comfortable, and even though close to the highway there was little noise you could here from the vehicles."
"The location was perfect for us and the staff was pleasant, but definitely overworked/understaffed. The website said the hotel was recently renovated so I was unimpressed by the bathroom fixtures and amenities. It just didn't live up to the Embassy Suites standards, in my opinion."
"How awesome!  We're glad you had a great time at our property and hope you had a blast at your Family Reunion!

We'll be sure to share your comments with our Gwinnett team!"
Was in town visiting family stayed here for the weekend the concierge was beyond friendly they have a Starbucks inside service was superior will definitely stay here again! Also love the proximity of the hotel with local highways to be out and about!
"No issues as expected with this hotel. Convenient to highway and many local restaurants.  Close to CDC and Emory.  Good breakfast buffet.  Hotel is undergoing renovations so elevators are occasionally being used by workers, but no noise or other issues associated."
"The staff were great!  They went out of there way to make sure that I was happy from beginning to end.  Whenever I needed assistance, there was someone available to help.  I highly recommend this hotel."
"I have stayed at this hotel for many years during business trips.  The staff is very friendly and helpful each time I come, no matter how long in between my trips.  The hotel stays up to date as well. The food service is good too!"
"Quiet room, but no one or just one person staffing checkout and checkin counters. My meeting was in the adjacent Hyatt tower but information to tell me how to get there and help by concierge staff inadequate"
"Love this hotel, location is perfect, accommodations are perfect and the food is amazing.  The staff is on top of helping and making sure your stay is perfect. I would highly recommend anyone staying at this hotel."
Was here for a business conference - the rooms were clean and spacious. The staff caring and friendly. The conference rooms were perfect. The grounds offer a pool and a zen garden (it is small but nice to sit in to read or relax)
Great facilities. Great staff. Excellent experience   The restaurant next door is also very good.   Best hotel stay experience I have had in a long while.   Every staff was accommodating and friendly.  Was travelling in a big group and they took fantastic care of us
"Had an excellent stay, great hotel with loads of amenities, excellent staff that go the extra mile, staff made our stay fantastic, was sad to leave. Have never been to Atlanta before, but now planning another holiday to Atlanta next year"
"Very enjoyable, pleasant and cooperative. Lots of variety and breakfast was overall great. Staff was friendly. Felt very secure when I saw physical security staff in parking area. Housekeeping staff was friendly and helpful."
Great modern style. Looks like it has been recently renovated. Awesome view from large picture window of downtown ATL. Had fully stocked kitchen. Gorgeous bathroom. Definitely glad we chose to stay here.
"The staff was not helpful and the hotel could a deep cleaning.  The location was great for getting to the airport.  But other then that, I would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.  This hotel Wes not up to Double Tree standards."
I'll be staying again and the Staff was LOVELY and Great area is nice and walking distance to McDonald's The price was great and great to be right next to the exit so again if your looking for a great hotel close to the exit
The Georgia Tech Hotel is a clean and modernly decorated Hotel.  Plenty of of good places to eat within walking distance. I have stayed there the last two years for business in July and have thoroughly enjoy it.
"All of the employees were fantastic to us in a very stressful time. They welcomed evacutees with pets and made us feel like we were home. The rooms were great, the food superb ad the service wonderful."
"Went for a three-day weekend with family. The room was super functional, clean, and relaxing. The pool was a big hit. Hot breakfast the next morning, including an omelet bar, was a huge plus! I would definitely recommend this hotel!"
"Excellent price for what you get: Everyone from check in to check out were friendly, professional and courteous."
Katina in the restaurant is absolutely amazing!!! She is the best server weÃ¢ÂÂve encountered while being in Atlanta! Being from Las Vegas we know all about customer service and this lady deserves a raise! Thank you got everything!
The hotel was clear and we really enjoyed our stay. The staff was very professional and from the time I made my reservations the hotel communicated with me by email.  The location was close to down town and the restaurants were in walking distance.
"This was my first time to Atlanta and I was very impressed with this hotel. Each room was a  suite, extremely clean, comfortable and in a nutshell, ""a home away from home"". I would totally recommend this hotel."
"Stayed here for 2 nights during the SEC Championship. Close to everything, with a gorgeous view of the park. Staff was super friendly and room was updated and nice. Enjoyed our time here and have booked the same hotel for this year!!!"
My family and I stayed here and attended an Atlanta Braves game.  The hotel was extremely clean and the staff was welcoming.  The location was great.  I would recommend this location to friends.  Look forward to staying here when we return to the Atlanta area.
"The Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta is conveniently located to many of the cities attractions, very accessible (especially to the MARTA), and provides an overall high-quality experience.  The rooms, services and amenities are top quality."
"Thankful for
Shuttle to from piedmont hospital  husband had unexpected open heart surgery.   . Front staff very accommodating    Beds comfy.  Wishing there was a micro wave in room.  Sink was high for a short person but worked well."
No free Internet unless you are a member and all the floors were sticky. Food made me sick. But the atmosphere was nice and the hotel was quiet. A great location for shopping at Lenox Mall. Would not stay there again.
I wish we were informed ahead of time that the hotel was under construction. The stay was not worth the money spent. The hotel was drab and dim. The water was turned off in the middle of the day. However the cookies were good.
"Friendly staff, nice rooms, accessible, but factor in extra wait time, and if you have any allergies, double check your food - room service is high risk!    Easy access to CNN Center and many other area attractions."
"Very clean hotel, wish parking was free for guests.  Hotel is within walking distance of many downtown attractions. I would stay here again and nay do so next month when I return for another convention."
We are glad you had a good nights sleep and enjoyed your stay here at the  Embassy Suites Hotel Atlanta Airport. Thank  you for such a nice review.
W hotels all provide spa-quality Bliss products for all guest rooms. We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your stay and we can't wait to welcome you back!
"The hotel is very clean, stylish interior and the rooms large and comfortable. Most important, the staff were very professional, courteous, and proactive. 
The location is accessible to a variety of shopping and within view of the new ball stadium."
This was class gathering it was great we decide bring us all together for nights of enjoying each other and living our lives to the fullest.we all had a good time take pictures laughing and dancing the night away
"We are glad you found your room comfortable and lean and want to thank you for your good review. We will look into your suggestion and see if something can be done. Once again, thank you."
"Hotel was extremely close to all the Altanta touristic spots (Coke factory, Aquarium, Olymipic Park and College Football Hall of Fame)  and in a great location for resturants (Johnny Rockets, Chris Ruth and a Bier Garden to name a few)."
The Ellis was a nice surprise. I was in a bind from a bad booking at another establishment and luckily the Ellis had rooms. It is centrally located minutes from Georgia Tech and Georgia State. Great restaurants close by. MARTA at the doorstep.
The room was very nice and clean. The establishment was well staffed and housekeeping did great job keeping rooms clean. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable.  Traveled with friends and staff was good about informing of local eateries and things to do.
Parking was a problem. Cost of parking was a problem. We were not informed about the parking problem. Room were Great. Great location. Staff was great. Love our stay! very GOOD WORK OUT AREA. Nice pool.
"Stayed here over night to catch an early flight.  Room was in need of renovation. Bath room sink was cracked.   Staff could use a refresher course on how to welcome guests.  Bar service was good, and so was appetizer."
"The location is excellent for me. The rooms are comfortable. The staff is friendly. The breakfast selection, pretty good. The toiletry, great! Love the Templespa products samples! And getting the newspapers at yr door every morning, a real plus!"
This brand needs some updating. The rooms at this site just seem to be out of date dark and dingy. I have travelled through out the East coast and I am ready to look at other hotels like Marriot. Things change .
"This is an older hotel with updated lobby area.  The conference rooms have no windows. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The pool area is nice and there's a nice jacuzzi. The rooms feel a little tired and the lighting is awful, but comfortable."
Clean room. Excellent buffet. Pleasant Staff. Only complaint was desk chair was too big for room. Blocked aisle. Wingate remains one of my favorite places to stay in Buckhead.
"Over night stay for some personal time. The surrounding restaurants were nice for breakfast and dinner. If one is coming to the Atlanta area please consider the intercontinental hotel. Oh by the way, please go visit Lenox mall.."
"The hotel offered a 
Good spread of complimentary breakfast
Complimentary Hot snacks & drinks in the evening

Close to airport (and hence some aircraft noise at times)
Offers shuttle service to/from airport
Close to many restaurants"
"Long check-in lines, slow process.  Rooms nice, clean and well appointed.  Breakfast outstanding.  Have stayed here in the past and will stay here again.  Hopefully, issues with check-in will be resolved."
"older hotel. convention taking place for the two nights we were there so loud music in lobby at night and busy lobby/front entrance all weekend. room was quiet, older but clean. no issues. we didn't use front desk or restaurant throughout the visit."
"My visit to Atlanta was great, at first I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt to sure about staying at the Ramada but to my surprise they had a great restaurant and bar the bartender Gianna made great Long islandÃ¢ÂÂs and the Lemon pepper Atlanta wings are awesome"
This property was wonderful. Great location. The staff was amazing. Went above and beyond to ensure we were happy! Loved the room it was amazing. Close to places to eat and shopping. Would love to try the spa next time!
"The Mandarin never disappoints! Helpful staff and great views of Buckhead. It's located in the heart of Buckhead. Shopping, DIning, events, are in walking distnce of the hotel.Or you can escape from it all."
"Stayed one night.  Couldn't wait to leave. No shower curtain, mold, mildew, broken furniture, no cups, beds were stained. Floors stained. Disgusting. $18 parking charge.  Side entry doors open 24hr. No safety. You're better off in a tent."
Excellent customer service!!! Comfortable room with a nice work space. Don't get a room on the side adjacent to highway...pretty noisy with trucks and loud motorcycles. Great breakfast and very nice wait staff. Nice lobby for socializing
"Average hotel. Air Conditioner in my and a friend's room ran constantly but didn't get cool. 

Nice workout facilities and attached to Lenox Mall. I've stayed at 8 different Buckhead hotels and prefer Intercontinental."
"My experience was what I expected, AWESOME! the accomodations are worth the parking fee that is charged upon arrival. My overall experience was great and can't wait to return to Atlanta so I can experience Embassy Suites again. Thanks"
Stayed here many times over the past ten years. Great business and leisure facilities. Very comfortable beds and friendly staff especially those behind reception and the bar. If you need a hotel close to the Galleria Area then this is the one to choose.
"We are excited to hear that you had a perfect weekend getaway while staying with us and appreciate the great comments about the hotel and our team.   We hope to see you again soon for your next weekend getaway.

Thank You,"
"After getting rooked by Embassy Suites down the road, Sheraton took care of me on a moments notice and made my bad day a good one.  Thanks so much.  The room was spacious and clean and the staff was more than accommodating to my needs."
"This is an average hotel, although it seems a little old.  Rooms were clean.  Nothing special about it.  Just an average hotel at a decent price.  Beds and pillows were comfortable.  Friendly staff.  Hallways leading to the rooms were cold!"
"Just across from Braves Stadium.  Very easy to attend games and the service was terrific.  If you are looking for an early night on days when they have night games, go somewhere else.  Overall a great environment for baseball fans and the family."
Super friendly staff. Great service at the Market by early morning staff and comfy clean rooms. Convenient to local tourist sites and surrounded by many restaurants. CanÃ¢ÂÂt wait to come back to Atlanta
"I normally travel alone,  and am in downtown several times a year for business,  and this hotel is my go to.   Great location,  service,  comfort,  cleanliness,  and wonderful staff.    I always feel welcome,  safe, and comfortable here."
We were able to check in 4 hours early! The hotel is located in a very convenient spot! We even got to walk to a few of our restaurants/activities we wanted to check out! Beautiful view from our room also!
We attended a conference in the hotel. The accommodations both for the meeting and sleeping were excellent. The pillow top mattress led to a most enjoyable night of sleep. The staff were friendly and helpful. I look forward to my next meeting here.
"Convenient location for visiting much of Atlanta, the hotel was very clean and neatly furnished. Room felt new and well-maintained, though pillows were a little lumpy and dense. Staff was very helpful and accommodating throughout the property."
"Stayed here for a conference- room wasn't cheap but for the level of comfort and service, I would have expected to pay double what I did. The rooms were large and clean, the beds comfortable, and the service excellent."
"The hotel was nice, but their internet wasnÃ¢ÂÂt working! As a student, and wanting to get some studying in, this was a big let down! The staff was friendly, and the room was clean. However, with the internet not working I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt stay there again!"
"Excellent hotel, was clean, big and very easy to locate. Parking was a little extreme with price, only valet.  Loved morning breakfast, evening reception could have a better selection of food. Rooms were excellent as far as size."
"Clean, comfortable accomodations conveniently located in Marietta with close proximity to multiple eating establishments and highway access to downtown Atlanta.  Excellent value.  Good fitness facility."
We were in the Emory area for a family gathering.  The hotel was recommended by the hosts. The hotel is very nice in a pretty setting. If you need to stay in the vicinity of Emory I would highly recommend.
"Thx. so much for your review. We've passed your comments on to our team. We apologize for any inconvenience with your luggage. We're glad you enjoyed your stay otherwise, and our great Buckhead neighborhood. We hope you'll come back and stay with us again!"
"This place simply blew me away. We got a great deal on the room, and this place did not disappoint. The view was incredible, and the location was within walking distance of all sorts of attractions. Wow!!"
"This is a beautiful, huge hotel. We were there on a very busy weekend, but it was still easy to get service, have an elevator come, etc. We could walk to major attractions like Centennial Park. The rooms were large and clean."
A romantic getaway is a great way to celebrate your love! We wish you a very happy anniversary and look forward to welcoming both of you back.
Really beautiful indoor pool and outdoor pool. The rooms are really comfy and I had good view of the airplanes going by (: they have a Starbucks inside which is amazing!!! The conventions rooms are pretty big. Love it (:
Overall very good location in downtown Atlanta. Friendly Staff and decently maintained hotel. Check-in was good and room ready on time. Fitness Facility was good and was clean. WXYZ Bar had very friendly bartender.
We are really glad you enjoyed your with us and hope to have you back soon!
Our stay was nice.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  Hotel is clean and we feel very safe there.
I had a wonderful time at the Grand Hyatt Atlanta and would recommend anyone who appreciates quality to stay at this establishment when they visit Atlanta. The food was great and the room was very clean.
"Best customer service experience. Ashley, Gallery host is very personable, knowledge and genuinely cares about your stay in the area! Do yourself a favor and consider this establishment for your stay above all others!"
Enjoyed my stay when attending a conference at the Georgia World Convention Center.  It was close to the venue.  Loved the evening chance to unwind at the Manager's Reception that had a very good beverage selection.
"The Staff at this property are exceptional in professionalism, courtesy and assistance. Great hotel with a wonderful restaurant and managers reception each evening that is complimentary. Very Good location for flying in and out of Atlanta"
"From check-in to check out this was a perfect hotel to stay at.  Good location, but not easy walking distance to Suntrust park.  That's not important though, as they have a shuttle.  Awesome breakfast buffet with made to order omelets and pancakes.  Kids were free."
"We're so glad we could be of service and that your room was just right, and that our team could be of service! Please do come back and stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead!"
Loved the updated look of the Embassy Suites!  We loved the lobby and our rooms as well.  The staff was very welcoming and professional. We planned to meet up with family while in ATL and we certainly enjoyed our stay during the holiday.
"Nice hotel with very friendly and accommodating staff. If you need a wake-up call, better use your phone. Convenient location and the staff who work in the restaurant are delightful as are the other most of the employees. Overall, I recommend this hotel."
This hotel was perfect from check-in to check-out!  I would definitely stay here again.  Easy to find and near many downtown attractions.  Staff was very courteous and the accommodations were 5 Stars all the way!
"The staff was friendly, helpful, professional. They really made the stay enjoyable and made me want to return to this location. 
I thought the price was good for the location. I will be returning soon."
Great view. Excellent service. Awesome breakfast with both hot and cold options. Dara at the front desk hard working and very understanding. Only down was city loud (duh?) and room moderately loud as well.
"This hotel was beautiful. It's located in a great spot and the people were friendly and accommodating. The view was also great. You're surrounded by downtown Atlanta, but it's not loud. The room came with complementary water bottles and designer toiletries, not hotel brand."
"We stayed at the Four Seasons for a wedding and couldn't have been better served.  The staff was warm and helpful without being invasive, and the rooms were lovely.  we were there for just one night, and wish it had been longer.  we will return!"
Front desk people were very nice. It seems like the hotel was recently renovated. Everything was clean and up to date. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt use the shuttle service to the airport but it was available if needed. Reasonably priced. Would stay again.
Was completely satisfied with this visit. Top notch customer service. Many places could learn a lot from them. I will stay here again when we come back to atlanta. Rooms could use some updating and thats my only complaint.
A favorite place to stay when traveling for business. The breakfast is a wonderful buffet display with hot and cold food to choice from. Love their fresh baked chocolate chip cookie they give you at the front desk too. Helpful and friendly staff.
Everything about this hotel was great. Not a single thing wrong except for the Wi-Fi going down. And that happens everywhere. I will be staying here again in Jan. 2014. Breakfast selection is great and reasonably priced.
"We're so glad to hear your enjoyed your stay during your conference, and that our team could be of service. We love our coffee too! Thx. for being our guest. Please come back again soon!"
"Hotel looks fairly new. Had a not so stellar view of the construction across the street. Rooms are not large, but modern and comfortable. Large bathroom and walk in shower was super. All that you would expect from Hyatt."
My wife and I had a great stay! We loved the newness of the renovated rooms and the complimentary breakfast was superb! The staff was extremely welcoming. We will definitely be staying at Embassy when we visit Atlanta!
"This property lacks some panache, warmth and charm, but it does offer all you will need. Large suites and clean bedrooms. Open lobby area with full bar. Dinner was average with heavy pizzas - but staff seemed friendly."
Just can't say enough about the 2 gentlemen working the front lobby they are amazing.  Very clean hotel. Overall I was vey happy with entire staff and I love the southern hospitality.  Would stay there again and I will.
"Reception in this hotel is very good. Very quick and efficient check in and systematic recognition of Hyatt loyalty program status.
Large and clean rooms with good bedding and bathroom supplies.
Excellent lounge with drinks, coffee machine, and food."
"The room was nice, comfortable, clean; but the front desk staff was beyond my expectations (and I always have high expectations when it comes to customer service). Will be my Ã¢ÂÂgo toÃ¢ÂÂ hotel in Atlanta. Loved the area as well, felt safe."
Corey at the front desk was the best! I had an issue with my room not being available when I checked in and he went above and beyond to fix the issue. The room was fabulous and the bed was comfortable. Awesome hotel!
"I like the retro feel but with a family of 4 - not really big enough to be that comfortable.  Bathrooms just had that glass door that wasnÃ¢ÂÂt really closed. Ummm, not that impressed. Plus the valet is $40 a car! Ã°ÂÂÂ³"
"Stayed with my family for a weekend visit, not impressed. No jacuzzi as shown in pic & only two chairs in pool area. Be prepared to hear hallway conversations & staff carts. Too many choices in area-won't pick this hotel again."
We're so very sorry to hear that your room and stay were not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies.
This hotel has Excellent facilities and amenities. Outstanding staff and friendly service. Great value and convenience  to surrounding attractions  shopping and restaurants. One of the most comfortable beds I have slept in.
Nick Pope helped us tremendously and even checked on my wife when she wasn't feeling too well while I was out. He went above and beyond to make her feel comfortable. Everything else was also exceptional. Great location.
"We were very unhappy with this hotel. It was not work the money we spent. The walls were Paper thin and you could hear everything. Every loud car, people next door...it was bad. The bed was very uncomfortable. Hard as a rock."
"Central location, lovely hotel, great service. I would recommend this hotel for all kinds of trips: leisure, business, whatever. Can walk or Uber easily to most venues. Parking is expensive but convenient if you have a car."
"Exceptional overall, the staff was very accommodating. Our needs we anticipated and it made my stay wonderful, good date night Place and there are many Resturant's near by to included the mall right across the way."
"Great hotel with friendly, accommodating staff. Beds are so comfortable with wonderful bedding.  New elevators are very fast. Shuttle service to/from Nearby Marta station. Restaurant has good food at reasonable prices."
"Fantastic stay from start to finish!  Rooms are awesome,  staff super friendly and helpful,  great location within walking distance to all the sights downtown.  Will definitely stay again! The breakfast each morning was the best!"
This hotel is a gem in a great location. There was a good selection of restaurants in this area as well as lots of shopping.
"Enjoyed our stay. 
Everyone was professional. 
Breakfast bar was a bit pricey
Pool was nice
Movie night was nice 
Valet was good
Bellman was very attentive when we arrived
Liked the oecan whiskey tasting and learning how to tie a bow tie"
"The indoor pool was nice, but the rooms were average, and the extra charges for everything from TV programs, to a bottle of water, to internet was a bit much."
Awesome upgrade. Rooms very clean and breakfast was great. I'd definitely stay here again. I need to try out the indoor pool and awesome looking bar! Front desk check in was awesome but couldn't get anyone on the phone when I needed towels
Came here as past of a conference and everything was perfect!  From the food to the service I was very happy with what this hotel provided.  I would give them 6 stars if this website would let me!  Thanks you
"Good hotel for visiting Georgia tech campus.  Excellent buffet breakfast available.   Did not have car and was happy with ride from airport.  Train from airport and short walk from MARTA station North ave.  
Good restaurants and supermarket in walking distance.  Friendly staff."
"Right across from the Fox, parking right behind the hotel.  Great patio bar, best bed we have slept in!  Front desk upgraded us on his own...location plus service!  If you are attending anything at the fox theater, this is the place to stay!"
"I chose this hotel because of its localtion beside Lennox Square mall.

You literally have to cross the street to get there.

I found a very quiet and nice hotel. Completely met my expectations.

You have a variety of dinning options near by."
"It was very nice and welcoming, as soon as we walked in the people at the front desk ask how we were etc. the only thing is if you want WiFi it cost you $$. The rooms where great. Lobby was great!!!!!"
"We truly appreciate your comments and are very excited to hear that you had an Excellent Stay with again.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon to enjoy our team and our hotel.

Thank You,"
They  charged me the room fee twice as well as a deposit. When they returned the extra room fee they shorted me. That reminds me I never received my deposit back!  I will never plan a trip at this location.
Will definitely plan on returning. The staff was great. Kristina at the front desk was patient and professional. Great room with great staff. Bed was excellent and the environment was relaxing  this place is a winner!!!!
Walk through Centennial Olympic Park with the sound of children's laughter in the air. Feel the cool mist from the fountain while the Georgia shines. This hotel is right across from the Sky View Ferris wheel and next door to a Waffle House.
Really enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Easy shuttle from the airport. Nice big clean rooms. Breakfast + social every night. Really great staff very helpful and made me feel welcome. Easy parking and some decent restaurants withing walking distance.
"You have found our secret!  We do use fairy dust......  So glad you enjoyed your stay with us, come back and see us soon!"
"I visited here for a seminar today and spent the night here - last night. The room was quite modern with a very comfortable bed, modern furnishings.  The meeting rooms were nice and our lunch was excellent."
There for the weekend.  Great Service in Dining Room.  Great location for shopping and seeing the sites in Buckhead. Extremely spacious room with a  Nespresso Machine.  I highly recommend this hotel for families and couples.
"The hotel staff was helpful, they had convenience items I needed in pinch, and the food was excellent. I'd stay at this hotel again. 

I came for a conference and enjoyed the convenience to local destinations."
"Stayed at this hotel for my sons baseball tournament this summer.  The hotel was clean, comfortable and in a great location.  The front desk staff were both helpful and friendly.  I would stay at this hotel again"
Great little hotel with a restaurant right there which was very convenient!! Rooms were clean .the a/c wasnt the best but manageable.the restaurant needed some more help but the girls working did a great job keeping up. The food was wonderful!
The staff here is so friendly and accommodating.  The bed and linens were great as well as the shower.The restaurant was quaint and offered a nice variety.   It is in a great location to wonderful restaurants.  Great for a business trip.
"Pros:  great location, friendly staff, and a very comfortable bed. Chef freshly prepared our meals which were excellent. 

Cons:  small room, an extremely tiny bathroom.  No closet.

Would stay again but definitely ask for a room with a bigger bathroom."
Overall an above average hotel. The Wifi can easily get overwhelmed. I was not made aware and/or did not see any sign of a parking charge. I found this out by a flyer on my windshield on the last day of my 3 day stay.
"This hotel is dated, the breakfast was terrible, and the evening reception has their own brand of liquor.  Room service from Ruth Chris extremely expensive.  The furniture has treads that are coming loose and stained."
"I had a good time at the hotel. Everyone is friendly and helpful. I love having a bar/restaurant, pool and very clean gym . The only complaint I have is I'm not happy with the WiFi not being strong enough"
"It is simple: The quality of the visit to Atlanta always is directly related to whether you stay in the four seasons or not. Upscale service, staff, location, amenities, rooms, and so on. I totally recommend it!"
We have stayed at this hotel for several years and this time it looks as though it has been neglected.
We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and look forward to hosting you again...with better weather too!
The bartenders at this hotel are top knot! Donald Fountain and Mylita Washington are the dream team and they made my week fantastic! Not only fabulous service but the food- especially the roasted cauliflower soup is a amazing! Love these two and this hotel!
"My wife and I, only stayed one night but couldn't have been happier.  The location is what makes this place what it is.  It is located right in the middle of everything.  The rooms have been recently updated and are very spacious."
I arrived with no expectations and was met with GREAT customer service from Abel and a beautiful hotel! I love every book and cranny! I was upgraded no extra cost so that was even better. 10/10 will visit again!
"Amazing hotel with incredible atrium  and fabulous city views. However, our room did not deliver adequate air conditioning (cooling) which is important when trying to sleep. Bed was also a bit too firm."
People are friendly and service is good.  Rooms are small but expectedly so as it's a W Hotel.  Only issue is the bathroom floors and fixtures were not cleaned particularly well.  Definitely could use better attention to detail.  Location is not super crisp and clean.
"Overall, they have a excellent product. Location was great. Pool nice and clean.  Security present through out the Hotel they were well presented in their black suits with their badges displayed on their outter pocket."
Great stay and hotel. I'll add please include REAL scramble EGGS on the breakfast buffet. The fake eggs were terrible. Customers openly criticize the fake eggs during breakfast. A simple change to real eggs would go very far for your reputation. Thanks
"Staff was friendly and helpful. Online check in did not work as explained. Room was dirty, mildew growing in the bathroom tiles and wallpaper. Water backed up in the shower and food from prior occupant."
"We are glad to hear that you had a Great Stay with us and look forward to having you stay with us again soon to enjoy our hotel and team.

Thank You,"
"Very friendly ,helpful staff all around (front desk,cleaning,valet)
Very clean rooms (most important to me )
Very comfy beds ( plenty of pillows)
Just around the block from new suntrust  (Braves) stadium"
I'm not one to normally complain about our hotels or experiences but this one was the worst yet. The noise level from the interstate was very loud. We requested twice to love rooms and told all the rooms were that loud.
"Stayed 3 nights at Loews for a work conference that was hosted here. Great overall experience. Facilities, amenities, service, etc. all get high marks. Was also impressed to find a decently equipped 24/7 gym."
"Great location, you can walk to SunTrust Park and all the restaurants and shops. Nice pool area that looks over the Battery and the baseball field. Has a restaurant and bar. Very open area, Rooms are great, new, fresh and clean. Valet only at $38"
"Had a fantastic stay breakfast was delicious, housekeeping awesome, bartender took to long to serve my drink served 5 others instead so I left. Shuttle was awesome very courteous drivers rode alone and still felt safe."
"Nothing makes this Homewood unique. The lot was always full, pool busy, breakfast crowded.  The room was clean and comfortable. The wifi was ok. The gym was better than some."
This property is excellent for a 3 day or more stay in Atlanta.  It is close to most activities within a 20 minute driving time max.  The staff is always pleasant and helpful.  Any issues are taken care of immediately.  Very responsive
The manager and staff at Sheraton are amazing. Beautiful hotel and amazing staff.  They attended to my every need. Great hotel!!! You will not be disappointed! Thank you Chris Garcia for all of your help! Thanks again.
"Had a great time and will definitely stay again! Front desk and Bell staff very friendly and efficient.  

Shirley in the SPG  Club lounge was very sweet and welcomingÃ¢ÂÂ¦ That breakfast was delicious and beautifully presented. 

Ray and Debbie Lessans"
"Close to America's Mart and all downtown attractions, venues and MARTA. This is a hidden gem right on Peachtree Street. Availability for freshly prepared food on site 24/7 as well as many near by restaurants and pubs."
We stayed here for the night on a business trip and the view was fantastic. The beds were comfortable and the service was friendly. The young man at the front desk was so kind and helpful. This hotel is in a great location. Near everything.
"The staff is wonderful and every aspect of my stay exceeded my expectations.  Check in was so easy and the staff quickly accommodated my elderly mother.  The hotel shuttle to nearby restaurants is a bit plus.  Felix, the driver, is the best!"
Great hotel. Reasonable prices for 5 star. People friendly and helpful.  Service is great. Pretty area of town (north). On the rail so getting there from the airport is very easy and inexpensive. Forget the rental car
"Overall amazing. Except the valet. Very disappointed in that. 
Other than that,the hotel was great. The hotel hires a third party company for valet. I suggest keeping it in house or use another company."
Ms. England thank you for your review! My team and I had so much fun with you and hope to see you again soon!
"This hotel was awesome for my group. Very convenient, the rooms were great and the restaurants had great food. My group loved the convenience of being close to the airport but not far from all the happenings in Downtown Atlanta"
The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly and informative! We really enjoyed the breakfast(wished it was a little longer)but the overall experience was great. My 5 daughter really enjoyed!
I was amazed by the beautiful lobby overlooking the waterfall and zen garden. The staff was very accommodating and everything seemed to run very smoothly. I would absolutely recommend staying here whether for business or pleasure.
"I recently stayed at this property for a business trip and was very pleased with the cleanliness of the hotel and the rooms, the friendly staff, nice fitness room and quick room service.  I would stay here again."
"There's a charge for both parking and food... you don't even get a complimentary cracker. And if you are susceptible to motion sickness, make sure you're on the bottom floor because the elevator is sickeningly fast."
"Hotel is OK. A little overpriced, but you pay for location since it's close to everything. We had problems with the A/C. Other than that, our stay was ok. The restaurant, Legal Seafood was great! Best part of our stay!"
"Beautiful hotel. Great location and great service. Loved the restaurant and the view on the top floor. Went here for business and despite one of the meeting rooms being really cold, meeting rooms were easily accessible."
Very nice Hotel and very friendly Staff from top to bottom. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Easy on and off the interstate. I had a free up-grade which was very nice. Very friendly Front Desk and Bartender. Very Clean and fresh smelling rooms.
"Staff were very pleasant.  Room was comfortable and quiet.  Location was very good.  Easy to access everything/place I needed.  Was there for a conference, so didn't really get to restaurants, but conference meals were very good and servers were awesome."
"Friendly staff,  good breakfast and close to business.  Lots of restaurants nearby and staff gave good directions.  Also close to the new Braves stadium.  Would be a good place to stay after it opens. you could walk to and from games."
Very nice room comfortable bed.the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions for places to eat dinner. We chose the Hard Rock which was in walking distance.The parking was included in our package as was tickets to the aquarium.
Great hotel on north side of Atlanta Airport.  Immaculate public areas and guest rooms. Very friendly and helpful staff. Plenty of parking. Evening social with comp food and drinks. Best airport hotel.
"Would have been a 5 should be 4-1/2 if they had it, however, rooms are a bit tired. Everything else was great. Room size - comfortable, (another reason no 5 was shower curtain not shower glass), service was fantastic from check-in to check-out."
"jenee was excellent, staff very helpful, the facility was very clean, the food surrounding the area was great. the gym was nice and warm for a good workout and the lobby lounge was very friendly. I would recommend this hotel."
"The chefs are amazing, fir a one of a kind lunch experience, YOU HAVE TO GO TO THR BURGER BAR/CHEFS TABLE,  and dine in the kitchen.  Incredible team to watch and the food was steller... must must MUST have the ohey goey!!#!"
"We work hard to maintain an atmosphere that is very new and next, edgy and fun. We're so glad to hear you enjoyed the lively atmosphere!   Also, our modern hotel rooms are scheduled to be revised with our upcoming renovation, which is very exciting!"
"My business stay was tiring with little sleep.  Between the noise and inappropriate language coming from the room across the hall along with being very close to I-85, my comfort level and sleep was very low.  I would not recommend this hotel."
IÃ¢ÂÂve stayed at many Homewood Suites. Many have both pros and cons however no cons at this location. The staff was amazing and we were entertained every morning for breakfast by a staff member. I highly recommend
One of the most enjoyable hotel stays I've ever had. The friendly helpful staff were just amazing. Was almost wishing I could move in! Everything was thought of and there was always great advice on dining and adventure.
The hotel was excellent proximity to the Georgia aquarium. However staff was not very helpful when dealing with the hotel aquarium packages. I don't believe I would stay at the hotel after the last visit.
"Great location!  Adequate hotel.  Attention to detail needs to be better.  Phones in room did not work.  Stale oatmeal and curdled cream at breakfast.  Had to ask for cookies.  Not perfect, but I would stay there again."
"Anthony, we are so very sorry your experiences with us were not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityaltra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies."
Have stayed here multiple times. Good experience every time. Only a couple of miles from the Marietta Diner. Rooms are very clean with good amenities. Love the cookie at check in. Will continue to stay here
The only recommendation I can make is for the front desk to advise on how to get to the floors. Other than this recommendation I think everyone has been very accommodating from the front desk to the cleaning team.
"After driving 14 hours from Miami, the hotel decided to cancel canceling my reservation  without noticing me in advance and give the room to other client.

4AM in the morning and i have to find another hotel on Memorial weekend.

Worst service ever."
"the rooms are dark and smell of smoke, the place is in need of upgrades, the bathroom has mold on the walls and stains on the ceiling. there is trash all around the parking area. the dining room needs more staff"
"What an awesome hotel, service, rooms, decor, location.  The most impressed I have been with a hotel in a long time.  I will never stay anywhere else when visiting the Americasmart.  The decor is beautiful."
Excellent location to downtown Atlanta. Bartenders were very friendly and provided the best service. Friday karaoke night was the highlight of my stay. I definitely will be back whenever I have to stay in the Atlanta area.
"I have heard about the horrors of bedbugs but have never, ever experienced them until this week. I was horrified to discover them in my room. Management took one night off of my stay but I am terrified of bringing them home with me."
"Room, location and staff were all exemplary. I would highly recommend this hotel  for doing business in the midtown Atlanta area. The Emory area is also beautiful with access to the campus and the ability to walk in some of the parks in the area."
"A terrific boutiqe hotel that is one of a kind. Good staff, lovely lobby and rooms, reasonable rates, great location in the Arts District and close to MARTA station. We have stayed here before and hope to come back again."
Accommodations are average.  Staff was extremely friendly.  Breakfast was extremely limited and not very presentable.  We wouldn't have tried lunch or dinner.  Transportation by cab was at times difficult.  Would recommend Uber.
Great place because of the caring staff....Tomesha at front desk and Yasin were terrific. The breakfast was terrific. The complimentary van service back and forth from the airport was really convenient. Thank you!
"Convenient Buckhead location, across the street from Lenox Mall.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Room was clean, beds comfortable.  The concierge lounge offers a decent breakfast and the ladies who work in the lounge are wonderful!  Great gym.  Easy access to I-85."
"An average stay. Nice remodeling done a few years ago. Fresh and clean, but it canÃ¢ÂÂt make the mediocrity of this property. Not bad, but not great. Happy hour free drinks is a nice touch. Beds could be more comfortable and internet connection was confusing"
"Wow!  Thank you so much for such an amazing review and for complimenting so many of our talent!  We are very proud of our team and we have very high standards for the talent we hire. 
We hope to see you again soon!"
This is a beautiful property with great service...from a clean room to prompt valet and great breakfast! The guest service was friendly and helpful. The location was convenient to our venue because we could walk.
"great location, walking distance to mall, clubs, restaurants...just a pretty walk overall. room was clean, decent size, nice view, no complaints here. except maybe the parking garage a little tight but normal"
"I wasn't expecting this hotel to be as wonderful as it was based on ratings. Robert at the front desk was outstanding! Breakfast was typical ""help yourself"" hotel fare, but overall a wonderful hotel.  We really appreciated the free upgrade.Would definitely state here again."
"This hotel is 2 blocks from my friends and very close to midtown Atlanta nightlife. The hotel is beautiful, well maintained and the rooms are spacious. Oh and the staff is friendly and helpful as well. I would definitely stay there again"
"Hotel as such was very good, but parking is paid and its crowded all the time. Breakfast also was not complimentary, so had to spend money for the same. Centrally located and near to Downtown Atlanta, GA."
I visited your hotel in February 2018.  I was greeted by Angela and Mellisa.  They were very helpful.  Their energy and demeanor were fantastic.  I enjoyed my stay and will continue to use your Hotel whenever I am in Midtown.
"Average room, substandard staff/service.  Excellent restaurant - Ruth Chris on property.  Lost a phone charger that is now someones property or on eBay.  Made 3 calls to lost and found with no response.  Management was equally disinterested."
We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us! Thx. so much for your review. We have the largest guestrooms in Buckhead! Glad you could enjoy. Please come back and stay with us again!
"Nice room, very clean, great shower. We had dinner in the bar the food and service was excellent."
Everything from furnishings and equipment seemed worn and dated. Staff was very friendly and helpful however. There are other hotels in the immediate vicinity with equal rates that have a more updated experience.
Horrible experience.  Staff ignored request.  room was good but vents were filled with something white as if they were trying to stop the flow of air????  front desk would not answer phone calls from the room
She is wonderful. She has been so nice to us for the last two months. Makes a great drink and a great person to talk to. Not only does she take care of us but everyone around us. Probably my favorite bartender ever
Well located hotel at the intersection of I - 285 and I - 75 and near restaurants and shopping.  Well maintained but needs a refresh that is planned for 2014.  Staff very helpful.  Excellent value overall.
It is wonderful to hear about your fantastic stay with us and we appreciate the great comments. We hope that your travels bring you back to stay with us again. Thank you!
"Excellent service, hot made to order breakfast was delicious, staff was very attentive, we loved the bed and had a great night sleep! Beautiful scenery and dined at the  nearby Sage restaurant where we enjoyed live jazz music!"
"Was pleasantly surprise .  The staff is very courteous , rooms are nice , complimentary breakfast was pretty good .  We definitely stay at another Staybridge. On the last day they even gave us a voucher to eat breakfast at First ."
"Only complaint is that my room was not cleaned 2 of the days of my stay. One other time, my bed was made, but my sheets had not been changed. Other than that, great hotel. Great breakfast and bar area."
"A good place to stay quiet and functional you can get your work done with minimal interference. Everything works, internet, showers, and a great bed to sleep on. The staff is friendly and helpful and seek to make your stay as comfortable as possible."
This JW Marriott  keeps the club open over the Thanksgiving holiday--one of the reasons we selected it!  Spacious workout area and great proximity to Phipps and Lenox malls.  Friendly staff and easy check in and out.
"So many small issues: no alarm clock in room, complementary robe was ripped, room was not ready at check in, cold water handle broken. 2nd room: fridge broke, bathroom smelled like mildew, toilet ran a"
"The Front Desk Member, Skyll, took time needed upon my arrival. She was professional and pleasant.  The encounter with her upon check-in set the stage for how I expected my stay to be, I was not disappointed either."
"The room was is pretty good shape.  Some stain on an ottoman.  Bathroom tiled and marble, pretty good for price range in Atlanta.

However, I was very upset to have a lukewarm/chilly shower in the morning."
The bathroom was dirty and the hotel was going through renovations. It smelled like mold and mildew. Buffet staff sucked.
"Of course, we are talking about Buckhead, Georgia, here.  The task of finding a decently-priced hotel in this area is pretty hard.  But if you are looking for a boutique-style hotel that delivers reasonable value-for-money, the ""W"" in Buckhead is probably your best choice."
"Hotel was super nice. However, we needed forks to eat in our room & they charged me $3.00 plus delivery charge, plus 30% tip ..... They also never cleaned our rooms or provided clean towels - guess they were too busy"
Great value for the location.  Room was huge!!!  All staff was very friendly and courteous.  Hats off to the valet guys working in the very cold temps!!  Thanks for a great stay!  Will gladly stay here again!!
We stayed here for one night recently and enjoyed our stay. There was a lot of traffic coming in from the airport. I guess this is a go-to place for people with layovers. I could tell lots of airline people stay here.
"Thx. so much for being our guest. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay, and our Japanese Garden and complimentary shuttle. Please come back again soon!"
The Ellis Hotel is a gem of a hotel. The location in downtown Atlanta is ideal.  It is next to a Marta station and new Atlanta streetcar that can get you to many attractions in the city. The restaurant also had great food.
"I've been staying here when I travel to Atlanta for about 40 years.  It is comfortable, classy, safe and represents excellence personified...a bit dated, but who cares.  The Ritz is simply The Ritz...alway will be."
"The room was clean. Bathroom and showers were never very as well. I felt safe and secure in the hotel. A complimentary bottle of water would be appreciated after long travelers. Im not a City person, but this Hotel helped me feel at home."
"I stayed at the Atlanta Sheraton for a Conference.  It was nice, everything was great!  I just think that the people who clean the room missed a hair in the shower, but everything else made up for that."
"Rooms was very nice, spacious and clean. The price was great for the area. Everything  was walking distance of where the hotel is located. Great employees. Nice and helpful.  I will definitely  go back and stay anytime"
"Overall good place to stay, need more attention to dusting vents,they were really dirty,also no smoking rooms smelled like smoke ,breakfast was good,service was great, check in was great as we late,Np"
"Great hotel, great service, very nice gym, pool and food! The room has everything: hairdryer, Irontable, Iron, microwave. If you.want to eat something fast and delicious, try their chicken sandwich, Its great!"
"This is a lovely facility in an ideal setting!  The staff are friendly and helpful, the amenities were just what we needed - just an all-around comfortable and enjoyable experience.  We are looking for excuses to go back and stay longer!"
"Wonderful hotel, with shuttle service to and from airport. Free breakfast was awesome. This is a park fly stay hotel close to the airport which was very handy. Front desk was very helpful. I would recommend this hotel."
"Very clean, friendly staff and excellent service.  Would definitely stay here again!  Location convenient to theater area.  Directly across from a Marta stop. Short walk to area restaurants. Also nearby free shuttle to a nice shopping area."
"Rooms are okay but somewhat dusty. During my stay, they were doing renovations in the room above me, which disturbed my sleep. They provide free Internet access and streaming from Netflix was no problem."
"Expected more from the Hyatt brand.  Lobby seemed slightly shabby and worn, as did the room, and the bed and pillows were not comfortable.  At first neighborhood seemed a little sketchy, but once we were oriented, we realized there were some good restaurants close-by."
"We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us during your event. We are centrally located in the heart of Buckhead! Glad you were able to enjoy our hometown. Hope you can stay with us again, soon!"
"I stayed here on a business trip.
Laquissa  welcome me with a big smile. The staff in the restaurant could not have been more friendly. The staff accommodate your every need or request. Fabulous waterfall to view as you dine."
"Very cool hotel, very well decorated. Excellent service. Really enjoyed our one night stay here as it was a 5 min walk to good dinner and drinks location. Valet parking was very good too, car was brought back for us in the morning very quickly."
"Close to Coke factory, Aquarium, Olympic Park.  Glad they have a Starbucks in the lobby as breakfast items were not so fresh.  Valet Parking cost is higher than usual. But rooms are clean and staff is nice."
"178katherinen,

It is wonderful to hear that your stay was exceptional. I hope you will choose Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta on your next visit.

"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel as a start of our roundtrip through the USA. The hotel is clean, large rooms, and the staff is very helpfull. The pool is very large and clean. The hotel is close to the centre of Atlanta."
We stopped at the hotel because we enjoy staying at Hyatt Place Hotels. They have always been excellent facilities and with excellent staffs. This hotel continued this tradition. The hotel was very comfortable and the staff excellent.
"They don't have room service. At the bar there was a small menu of bar food, but it closed at 10 pm. They also sold snacks and candy bars . I will probably not stay here again because I always order room service."
"Beautiful hotel with a lovely staff. They gave us the most amazing suite on the top floor with a great view. Large, living room, dining room, wet bar with refrigerator, microwave and two bar stools. Good bathroom."
"Very accomodating staff and overall valuable service. The drivers, the front desk, the servers for breakfast and room service were amazing. This hotel obviously is a customer service focused organization."
We really enjoyed our stay. Was on 7th floor. Breakfast bar was nice. Hotel crowded at times. Pool area crowded at times. Had a really nice suite. Staff was friendly. Surrounding area had plenty of restaurants.
This place was awesome very clean and had  courteous people I would go back any day. Easy on and off the freeway which ever way your going. Located fairly close to the attractions that we were going to.
"this is an extremely outstanding hotel with truly a professional staff at all levels.  the hotel was clean, refreshing and comfortable.  I was made to feel at home throughout my stay.  I look forward to my next visit this Double Tree Hotel"
We're so very sorry you did not enjoy your stay with us. We've passed your comments on to our team. You may also reach out to us directly as well at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay.
"Excellent location to downtown bars/restaurants/attractions.   Walking distance to Coca-Cola Museum, College football Hall of Fame, Mercedes Benz Stadium, aquarium, & Tabernacle.  Wait staff were very friendly.  6th floor pool could use an upgrade along with the whirlpool. Spa available but did not use it."
"Very nice hotel. No tub in the bathroom which is fine with me but if you have young children, you may want to know this. Loved the hotel shuttle. The staff was nice. I would definitely stay here again."
"Best stay I've ever had in ATL.  Very cool, modern rooms.  Steps from Marta and less than $150.  Outstanding staff offered very good restaurant recommendations.  Can't wait for my next stay at this property."
"We have stayed at other Hyatts that eere awesome such as hyatt Coconut point Estero Florida.
The Hyatt Galleria is a disgrace to the hyatt brand.
Dirty noisy smelly room the kitchen odors from the lobby area  came up thruogh the air conditioner vents"
"The guest room was not ready (not cleaned up and very messy) so I had to change to another room. The changed room also had not emptied trash bin, and I found a lot of debris on the floor. They need better clean-up service."
Excellent. All staffs are very friendly and breakfast is great with lots of choices and high quality of food. I felt like home while staying at Hyatt House. Definitely will stay at again and strongly recommend to family and friends.
We booked this hotel for a wedding. I agree with the previous comments. The room was a good size and very clean. Property was very well maintained. Loved the location! Convenient to shopping and restaurants. Staff was very pleasant. Great experience.
Centrally located in buckhead near everything. Dexter is amazing and he goes out of his way to make your stay memorable. A couple times we wanted to get a drink the bar was closed as the lobby bar has weird operating hours
"The hotel was great! Comfortable beds! Location of hotel is right by the Cobb Center. The whole experience was wonderful! Staff helpful and friendly. Next visit to the Atlanta area, will definitely stay there!"
Phenomenal service! The front desk delivered two boxes of water to the bridal suite for my sister-in-law. They also provided double side tape for a projet I was completing. The atmosphere of the hotel was relaxing and welcoming. Thank you Four Seasons Atlanta!
I stay at this hotel every month.  I can't find anything negative to comment on.  From the front desk to the restaurant the service  is excellent.  Rooms  are clean and comfortable.  Great value for the dollar.
"I was passing through the area and although it wasn't a resort, the service from all departments was exceptional. The bedding in the renovated room was very comfortable. The pool area was spacious and offered a quiet and relaxed atmosphere."
I stay at the Ritz in Buckhead quite often the service is outstanding and the rooms are clean and it's a great location. I have not had a bad stay there in the past two years.We love it and the service is outstanding.
"We stayed one night because we were catching an early flight out. We stayed on the airport side and the kids loved watching the planes land and take off. Surprisingly,  it was not loud and did not interrupt any sleep."
"I appreciate that the room is exactly what is advertised, customer service was very good and she really helped me when I thought I would not be able to stay.  I am looking forward to my next stay with my family very soon."
This was our last night before flight home during Master's week.  The hotel room exceeded my expectations.  The staff was very friendly and rooms were very nice.  Wish we could have stayed here for more days of the trip.
"The staff was fantastic. The hotel was a bit tired though. Dated decor, stained carpet. Badly grouted tiles in bathroom. Lobby area is nice though. Right next to the highway so you definitely hear the noise. I slept well in spite of that though."
"Michelle was awesome! I had a few mishaps and she quickly stepped in and handled everything in a timely manner! Because of her, I had a pleasant stay! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who has a trip in this area!"
"Great midtown location w/attractive  rooms and lobby. Friendly & helpful staff. Decent lobby restaurant/bar.Walking distance to MARTA, many restaurants & Piedmont Park. Only complaint was the bed dipped in the middle and had very hard pillows"
"modern facility with clean rooms and a very nice restaurant very pleasant staff
would recommend this hotel for your next stay if you are in the Atlanta Airport area for business or pleasure you won't be disappointed"
"This is my third time to stay here. Very easy check-in, super location in Midtown, rooms are very comfortable, bathrooms on the small side but a great value. and the people are very nice and a little restaurant. I really enjoy staying here."
I think the person that assisted us with our luggage was Matthew....he was so great!! We changed rooms and he helped us move ...made sure we had all of our belongings.  He was also there when we checked out!! Very nice young man.
"Nice accommodation, no smoking facility!!. The only problem at the moment is the construction of the new baseball stadium that is producing a heavy traffic due to some intersection blocked. Great cookies and great service at the reception desk and restaurant."
"Nice hotel, but you're charged $10/day to park in their lot surrounded by razor wire in a so-so neighborhood .. disappointed: did not receive a DoubleTree chocolate chip cookie .. nice grounds, and a pool area surrounded by tall pines."
"This property is in the perfect location at the Battery!  You can arrive, park, stay and not have to use your car until you check out!  Loved it!  Entire staff that I encountered were friendly and helpful."
"Worst experience for a short family vacation and not a good place to stay for nice restaurants, shopping and tourist attractions!!! Very disappointed!! Maybe good for a overnight stay if catching a flight out but not for a family vacation."
The rooms weren't in the best quality. I was expecting better service from previous hotel visit.  The bedding had spots. When arrive to room iron was not put up according. The cord was hanging I could have actually trip over it  .
"The location is great and an overall great business experience with absolutely the best staff!

Unfortunately trip advisor forces me to write  more words so five stars for the Hyatt one star for trip advisor."
My wife and I have stayed at different hotels all over and we both are extremes please. This by far beats any other hotel stay. We stayed three days prior at a Hyatt in downtown Atlanta GA never again
"Thx. so much for your comments, and for being our guest! We're so glad you enjoyed your room and stay, and our lobby bar. We hope you'll come back and stay with us again!"
I was in Atlanta for just one night for business and chose the Renaissance.  The staff was friendly and the room was fine.  It's central to restaurants.  I was there alone and felt comfortable taking a walk for dinner.  I'd definitely go back!
"Staff , service is very bad, room was never cleaned properly even after asking housekeeping to do so. The carpet was dirty and not vacuumed daily. Hair was in the shower upon our arrival and not cleaned by the housekeeeping staff either."
"This hotel is unique, the lobby is beautiful. It is conveniently located within walking distance of all the major attractions and across the street from the train station. The rooms and comfortable and clean. I would definitely stay here again."
"Tucked away in the Most convenient place near everything. Quiet, Clean, The Best Customer Service, Beds are So Comfortable. We Love the convenience of the 2 bedroom apartment style suite. 3 TV's, one in the living room, and one in each bedroom."
"Although the room left something to be desired for the price point, the stay was very good. The service is outstanding. The concierge are best in class. Also, the Spa is probably the best you will find in the city. Great food and drinks."
"Great hotel. Perfect access to the terminal, and the rental car place via the train. The lobby area is good and the food is better. The room was new, clean, and very comfortable. Loved every minute of my brief one night stay. Great job!"
"Wow. Bailey, thank you for your kind words and for allowing us to treat you to a wonderful experience at Grand Hyatt Atlanta in Buckhead. We hope to welcome you back, soon."
"The staff was very accommodating and polite when checking in.  They always spoke when entering and leaving the hotel lobby.  We went to the hot tub around 9:15, however, the spa hours are strictly enforced and we were asked to leave by 10:00."
"Nice location. Had a little issue in shower, fixed no problem. Great res. and bars. Very pleasant stay for both me and my wife. Zach and his staff were outstanding host. Mitchell, the mascot, never gave up any secrets!"
The Hyatt staff were well-prepared for massive amounts of guests.  They never wavered and remained calm at all times.  Our stay went perfectly start to finish.  We also used valet parking which worked out well.
"Largest hotel room I've had in Atlanta. Not crowded, large bathroom, very comfy bed, great little bar in the lobby, Starbucks across the street. Great service Beautiful. Close to everything.great price"
"Exceptional staff, beautiful hotel with great views, the Bourbon Bar is fun and lively. The mixologists are very knowledgeable and helpful. Great rooms to kick back, relax and sleep comfortably or pamper yourself with spa treatments!"
Hotel sold my room and the rooms of several members of our party. Provided extremely poor conference services. Staff was unresponsive . Breakfast was terrible !! Don't stay here !! Find another hotel and spare yourselves the headache
I stayed here for 3 nights for a business trip. The sushi in the lounge was fantastic. Rooms were beautiful with a magnificent view of Atlanta. Stocked mini bar and nespresso machine made for a better selection than most hotels.
"Walking distance to stores & parks.  The hotel bar was also nice,  Breakfast was also great we had the buffet on Sunday morning.  Omelet station the chef was wonderful.   Parking garage was well lighted with security everytime I went to my car."
"A fabulous hotel with the most genuine and helpful staff.  We used the W for a business retreat, but it would absolutely be great for pleasure as well.  Centrally located we were in the heart of Buckhead and the food was amazing!"
"Service was fantastic. From the second I walked in I felt very welcomed. The staff went above and beyond before I even made it to my room. Very helpful and very approachable.

Room was clean and large. I am looking forward to staying there again."
"Nice atmosphere, helpful staff and cool rooms.  Decor is so modern and different.  Beds were very comfortable.  Food was good but not great.  Toiletries in rooms were from Bliss.  The lounge, called the Living Room, was great with free wifi."
"Great hotel and wonderful staff! Have stayed at this hotel many times and can always rely on great service and a comfortable stay. I would recommend any business travelers in the area to consider this to be their ""normal"" hotel stay when in town."
"Good atmosphere, clean room amazing hotel, near the mall for good shopping, excellent restaurants, near the highway and not far from downtown. Staff is quite pleasant and so is the service that is given."
Only stayed one night but I was nice. Rooms are nice and clean. They had a reception at 7ish that was ok. Food was ok (chicken was like rubber) but love the beer and wine. Shuttle service from the train station close by was nice.
"This hotel was clean but could use some updates.  The staff was extraordinarily nice.  We loved the queen suite as there was plenty of space, privacy, and 2 bathrooms!  It is about 15 - 20 minutes from the GA Done."
"This continues to be an excellent hotel.  The staff and their positive, help you attitude make this a great place to stay. The hotel's location is excellent to take advantage of all the entertainment in the city,
Particularly baseball games."
Lovely hotel in Buckhead.  Location..Location..Location this is where you want to stay.  Walking distance to shopping and lots of bars and seriously great restaurants.  The pool is secluded and beautiful.
"This hotel was very clean with a professional staff. Internet service also exceeded my expectations. I only wish I had advance notice of no free continental breakfast, but the Mickey Ds up the street was OK."
Great location made it feel like I was in a secluded location. Super friendly and helpful staff that assisted with luggage and transportation. The facility had an overall mountain lodge feel and really made me feel at home. I would definitely stay again!!
"Great central location.  Clean, well organized hotel and meeting place for team meetings.   Staff is positive and helps you with the arrangements.   Always available and responds quickly to your needs.   Food is very good."
"Wyndham had a friendly staff, a decent room and breakfast and a fair price.  One negative - WiFi that was way too slow."
We stayed at this hotel because we were in Atlanta to see a Braves Game and visit the GA Aquarium.  Nice hotel...great staff...friendly and service-orientedI  The cookies are amazing!!  Relatively close to everything we were visiting. I recommend this hotel!
"Nice service, clean room.  Great shuttle to the game, but drop off was on the other side of the freeway.  This may be due to congestion around the ballpark.  

Housekeeping came by at 9am to clean (a little early for me).  Nice area."
"Delicious coffee in the lobby.  Convenient to Georgia Tech, Atlanta Aquarium and other attractions.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Room very clean and spacious. We would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Atlanta."
"Stayed here for a concert just for a night. They never fail to amaze! service is excellent, rooms always clean, and the front desk is super friendly! You won't regret staying here! My go to hotel for all ATL concerts now!"
"The location of property is great but, for the cost your can find better properties in the area. Staff is average but, the breakfast spot, RuthÃ¢ÂÂs Chris is below average. The staff at RuthÃ¢ÂÂs Chris are not friendly nor helpful. One plus, Starbucks."
"My favorite hotel in Atlanta!! A relaxing oasis in the city -- lovely common areas with a lodge feel, beautiful and comfortable rooms, and excellent service. A delicious breakfast at the hotel restaurant, and late-night fun playing pool in the lobby!"
What and top rate place to stay.. My first visit to Atlanta and The Marriott came through once again. Lovely rooms with a lovely staff:) thank you all for a wonderful stay.
"Havelyn totally made my three nights at the Crowne Plaza, what an incredible hostess - from suggestions of what to do in town, to smiling every day conversation.  Thank you Havelyn - you are a total gem!!!"
The staff was great and very attentive. Would definitely stay again! The breakfast was also amazing and so was the breakfast staff. The room was comfortable and the hotel overall was great! Only negative was the $30 per night parking!
Having eye surgery next door; Sonesta made this exactly what I needed from great room to transportation and even provided free meals. Friendly staff also from hotel staff to Shuttle driver! Would definitely recommend!
"This is a very nice hotel, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the area. The breakfast was amazing, I can not say enough about the omelet chefs. Our suite was spacious, as always with the Embassy, they never disappoint us."
"The room and hotel were very dated. Didn't look like Ritz Carlton at all. Need complete overall to bring it up to Ritz Carlton standard.  The staff was very courteous, professional and provided excellent service.  No free internet."
"Love this spot. Close to everything. Lots of restaurants, Marta and Americas Mart.
Rooms are on the smaller side. However the corner rooms, are great, extra space and a couch. Very clean, comfortable beds and linens, love the robes."
A great hotel in a great location with an excellent staff.  Our stay was rewarding and relaxing that fully supported our family reunion and all of the events.  This hotel was located in a great location with full acces for shopping and eating.
"This is a very large hotel in the centre of the city, close to the I85. 12 miles from the airport. Requested a non-smoking room but it smelt smoky. Refer firm pillows but there was not a choice of pillows."
"The staff at the hotel were highly knowledgeable, friendly, and caring.  The manager and front desk staff went above and beyond to make sure that our accommodations met our needs.  Great group of people.  Angela, Sylvia, and Keith."
I stayed at this location while attending a training. The rooms were good- bed was comfortable for a good nights sleep. The parking on the other hand was not the best set up.
We stayed 4 nights with the Hyatt Place and it was great! The bed was amazingly comfort and everything was very clean. We loved the daily breakfast. We look forward to another stay with Hyatt. The downtown location was perfect for us.
Room was nice & all of the people working here were friendly and helpful.  We had a meeting here and it was great.  Room was good & plenty of snacks & food.  The airport was right next door & I could barely here the planes.
"Convenient location for Midtown. However, 2 of 3 elevators were out of service, no towels were left in room after 1st night maid service, vents in bath exhaust were filthy, AC made load noises, and shower hot/cold adjustment would not work.  Maybe try somewhere else."
"Considering its a JW(my first stay at one), I would of thought it would be top notch and comparable to the likes of a Four Seasons(stayed at many).  Not even close, maybe other JWs will prove me wrong.  The staff was great and very helpful."
Very nice hotel in the center of everything. The bed is very comfortable and the shower was amazing!  The decor of the room and hotel are very modern. Check in was fast and staff were friendly. Will definitely come again
"Excellent hotel 
Even though Isis such a huge place does feel that way 
Excellent staff well mannered 
Took care of everything 
Location is great 
Connected a huge mall with great food courts 
Did go to the local restaurant"
I like the location. Clean rooms. Staff upgraded my room just because it was available. I did not have to ask. The wait staff at the bar should be more attentive. The room was nice. Good TV and selection of channels.
Stayed for our anniversary as well as an ATL Falcons game... great location for both. Walking distance to MANY local restaurants and things to do. Love the cookies at check in.. such a simple thing but such a nice touch. \
"We received a warm welcome by the hotel staff! They were helpful with finding a restaurant, and helping us find our concert destination! Very impressive young women! We will come back to this hotel for our next Atlanta stay!"
The Atlanta Four Seasons is a nice hotel.  The service was excellent and the food was good. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Not the best Four Seasons I have stayed in but certainly a wise choice of Atlanta hotels .
Everything was perfect! when I arrived I was able to get checked in quickly. Our room was nicer than expected.. The shower was extremely big and the room gave us great comfort. I will def plan another stay at this hotel soon!
We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and hope to see you again soon.
"What great comments!  I'm so glad you enjoyed your time with us and we wholeheartedly agree about Tina, she's a gem and we're lucky to have her on the team.  We'll be sure to recognize her for the outstanding service she gave you."
"Excellent property.  Room was a decent size, modern with a patio.  The bed was one of the more comfortable beds I've experienced at a hotel.  The shower was great too - no issues with water pressure.  I will stay here again."
"Great hotel. I was here for a conference. Great food, friendly staff, clean room. For whatever reason, I was given a handicap room. The bathroom door was wide and heavy and would not stay open. Great shower. Bed was VERY comfortable! Great stay"
It was a convenient location for a downtown Atlanta meeting. The front desk staff was super friendly.  The decor is mod and contemporary.   Average room. No complimentary breakfast.  The hotel had breakfast items for sale.
"I whole heartedly apologize for your subpar experience and would like to learn more. I have sent you a private message with my contact information hopeful that we can connect to discuss further. Sincerely,"
"All of the hotel personnel were absolutely wonderful, very accommodating, professional and friendly without being intrusive.  Located in Buckhead (great area) and within walking distance to other fine restaurants and the very fine LW Chocolatier!"
"Our favorite property in Atlanta!  A gorgeous property with exceptional staff.  Although everyone on property is gracious, Linda on the front desk really stands out.  She epitomizes everything about the St. Regis. Can't wait to go back."
This was a great hotel in a great location for what we were looking for. The rates were reasonable. The staff were all nice. The facility is beautiful and clean. The rooms were spacious and clean. A great stay for a girl's night out.
"This was a beautiful location provided thru orbit to know our needs and wants, it is a must have to stay at this located again in the future. The chandeliers were my favorite view thru out coming in the doors."
"Can be recommended if location and fair price are of primary importance. Quality of building infrastructure and rooms OK, but not recent. Breakfast acceptable, although served in a tiny and rushy place. Friendly and helpful staff."
Great stay. Only negative - ice machine/vending machine did not work on our 4th floor. A bit inconvenient. Would love a small fridge in room.
"I travel on business several times a year to various locations.  I must say that the Hyatt Midtown is one of my favorites!  The location, service, comfort of lobby/room, available amenities can't be beat!"
The service delivery by the staff at this Hotel is simply amazing and distinctly better than any of the 5Star Hotels in Atlanta. This was my first visit and for sure I will be returning! Booked my next trip already. Thanks to the hotel staff.
Stayed here for one night.  Everything was great.  Walking distance to good restaurants.  Large clean modern room.  Staff was super friendly and helpful.  Parking lot was fine for me.  They were able to get me in the lot with a reserved spot.
"This is certainly one gorgeous hotel. The Staff is friend my and out going. Thanking us for coming and welcomed us back. The room on the 8th floor off, with a Beautiful  view of downtown was perfect and quiet.
Thanks fir a wonderful stay."
"Excellent facilities, spacious rooms, staff goes above and beyond to make your visit enjoyable.  Weight room, pool, banquet halls, and elevators move guest quickly to their room.  Valley parking is offered and will cost you extra."
"Would stay here again in a hot minute.  The rooms were great and spotless.  The bathroom is nice with a walk-in shower, I hate tub showers.  Overall a great deal and well maintained hotel.  The shuttle is spectacular and fast."
"I often stay at the Renaissance Waverly, as I have a client located nearby. I like this hotel very much: The rooms and public spaces are nice, the staff friendly and helpful, and the room rates are reasonable.

I will certainly return."
"Charged for a glass of milk for a kid! Being exploralist... doesnÃ¢ÂÂt count! Party on the room above until 3am, security called and they said Ã¢ÂÂwas it better afterÃ¢ÂÂ... oh yes between 3am and 6am was great!!!"
There was construction going on that was not implied when the hotel was booked.  Traveled all day to have to come in and relax to the sound of jackhammers on the floor below us.  Could have been a 5 star.
Had a wonderful three day stay. Staff was wonderful.  Room was great. Pricey to park car. Adjacent to upscale Lenox Square Mall.  Free Limo service within 2 mile radius.  Couldn't ask for anything more. Will return again
"Thx. so much for your review, and for being our guest. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and our great breakfast! Please come back and stay with us again, soon!"
"Stayed for 3 nights for work. Hotel was good, but there is no room service, no bar, and no place to eat. They do provide complimentary breakfast, which was nice. Full kitchen in the room if you want to eat in. Overall a good stay."
"The hotel itself was a good price, the front desk staff and valets were great.  We weren't very excited about paying $31 per day for parking or $15 per day for Internet.  Make sure you consider those items when making a reseervation."
Enjoyed staying in the Buckhead area.  So close to good food and shopping.  The complimentary shuttle for the local area was great.  The complimentary breakfast was great and so was the evening happy hour.
Under construction. Staff not helpful.  Room was hot and stale Union entry.  AC wasn't working and maintenance had to come in.  As an honors member this was extremely disappointing.  Would not stay here again.
"Friendly and attentive staff, attractive building and rooms, and convenient location. The restaurants provided excellent service. Overall, I highly recommend the Westin Peachtree Plaza and choose it first when traveling to downtown Atlanta."
"I really like my stay at that hotel, It make you feels like you didn't leave home, because all you need in a home, this hotel gave all to you. nice little kitchen, living room, close bedroom etc. love"
"After a wild night(s) at shaky beats concert, Shane welcomed me back to the hotel with friendly service and made my stay worth while. The bartender was so friendly as well and made us some awesome drinks. 10/10 would recommend."
This hotel offers great service and a fun nightlife. Roof top bar and fire heaters to keep you warm in the cooler months. Friendly service and good atmosphere. Comfortable rooms and nice pool. We would recommend for any conference stay.
My only complaint was due to being overcharged and it taking several days to have my money credited back to my account.  I was charged fees for incidentals on two separate occasions for a one night stay.
The staff were very friendly. The hotel was quiet. But it was overpriced and in need of refurbishing. The shower was moldy and the shower door did not close. Drinks at the bar were very expensive. View from the sky lounge was amazing.
Stopped here on our way to Florida. Aquarium is right across the street.  After 4:00 discount tickets available online only.  Legal Seafood was attached to the hotel which was convenient.  Great place to stay!
Had a blast at the hotel.  The staff was great and very friendly especially Jamal and Destiny. The room eas beautiful and clean. I will be recommending the hotel to my freinds and family and will be booking my next trip. Wil be back soon.
This hotel is in a great location. What made it really special for me was the amazing friendliness of staff. They were very accommodating in all departments. The hotel is getting a bit dated but overall it is fine.
Bathtub drain was stopped up and the shower handle was tight and hard to operate in room 610. I had to checkout early and the hotel still charged me the $50 fee. They should have at least waived the 50
I have stayed at this hotel several times...the manager lady there takes responsibility to ensure you have a good stay...one of the few US hotels where they remember guests and not by their Marriott rewards number. Good restaurant and friendly staff
"Clean, friendly staff, decent size rooms, ample parking adin a great location.

Cons: Some staff need to be trained on how to triage the SPG Gold and Platinum line.

Pros: Gold members ca get Platinum level upgrades for a small fee/points."
"Enjoyed a wonderful visit for a family wedding. Exceptionally friendly staff (shout out to Chanel P and Harry). Great service and delicious restaurant options. Loved the soft pillows, lovely Aveda products, sparkling clean bathrooms, and the amazingly effective room darkening blinds. Would recommend."
My car was somehow entered in the secure parking area and several items worth $140.00 were taken.   This hotel refunded the room charge which was more than my loss.  A great way to handle the problem!  This is a great chain for traveling with pets.
"Clean rooms, staff was above & beyond amazing.  Very lovely hotel & rooms were decorated beautifully.  Having an indoor & outdoor pool was definitely a plus.  The cook to order breakfast was as well.  No issues And will stay again"
"Best staff, liked room size and amenities,enjoyed our trip but a few hiccups along the way. They forgot to make 1 of our 2 bedroom and baths one day. We thought the finish work could have been checked more in the suite."
"This hotel was horrible from check-in to check-out.  AC didn't work so they gave us a fan to put in the window, room smelled and the floor was dirty.  There was no working bathroom fan and the desk associates were rude, rude, rude!!!"
We are very sorry for the issue that has been brought up.  The spa had to be shut down longer than expected to replace the heat unit.  This has just occurred and is in process.  Parts had to be ordered
"The Hyatt Regency Atlanta was excellent in customer service, friendliness, and overall hotel hospitality!  The room was attractive, clean, comfortable and spacious!  The beds were absolutely wonderful!  The staff was superb!  Thank you!"
"Great location close to the train but what is so impressive is the hospitality of everyone from the front desk, to the restaurant staff, to the valet, and hotel security. Nicole and Raven at the front desk were phenomenal- always helpful, friendly, and smiling."
Great place to relax after a day of constant meetings.  Clean and comfortable!  I had great WiFi service and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  I would highly recommend this hotel for both business and pleasure if having to make a stay in Atlanta!
"Meeting high school friend ...relaxed by the pool for 2daysÃ°ÂÂÂAndrew, poolside bartender was wonderful...friendly, really made the place fun...drinks were great too
Everyone here have been superb!Top notch service"
"Been here about a week and a half now and so far my stay has been great. The best part about my trip has been Miss Connie! SheÃ¢ÂÂs the best, very welcoming and dedicated! I will definitely be back to see her again"
"We hosted people from several branches of our company and had great service.  Meeting rooms were nice, service outstanding and food excellent.  Our needs were met through all phases and made the week a good experience."
"Stay at this location for a week and love every minute of it comfortable beds, great hot water and pressure, clean rooms and bathrooms, and wonderful customer service.  I will stay here every time I come to atlanta"
"Providing Whatever/Whenever service to our guests is our specialty. 
Glad we could amplify your stay!"
How embarrassing is it when you open your hotel roomTo find the people have not checked out.  HowÃ¢ÂÂs that for Hotel security.  The front desk apologized and gave me an upgrade. Same room style but oh boy view of the city.  Big deal.
Rooms were very clean and very comfortable. My only negative is we arrived a little early 1 hour and we were not allowed to check in. So at 3pm check in time they had quite a line and wait. All could of been avoided.
"The rooms were great, the staff was very helpful.  Our event was handled professionally and with friendly service.  Special thanks to Sonya, Keshia, Sherman, Reggie, Alioune, Saihou and Denzel for a job well done."
"Edge of college campus area. Great jump off location for visiting the neighborhoods/sites in Atlanta. Room was clean, comfortable and well furnished. Walking distance to several restaurants. Well served by Lyft car service"
"Was in town for a Business Conference. The hotel is very convenient to the Aquarium, the Coca Cola Museum and the Convention Center. The room was clean and the Staff was friendly. The free breakfast is also a plus."
"I have stayed here 3 of the 4 last trips to CDC for a yearly visit. It is so close and near some very good choices for lunch or dinner. The bar, restaurant and patio are all good and service was excellent"
Stayed here for my annual military reunion and found it to be a little over priced. Rooms were not turned down in a timely manner. Breakfast buffet did not provide enough options. Very friendly staff.
"not worth the money, 15 min drive to atlanta, rooms are average, bar isn't a bar, person making drinks had no clue. breakfast was a mad house. bad coffee. this is north of Atlanta. this hotel does allow dogs."
My family and I have always had a positive stay and experience.  Recommend the location and facility with free transportation to local shopping and areas within hotel location.  Breakfast is always a plus.
Friendly and courteous staff.  Walking distance to College Football Hall of fame and great restaurants close by.  Will definitely stay here again.  20 minutes from airport and about 30 minutes from Sun Trust Park.
Great stay. Great location. Walking distance to EVERYTHING! Went to the World of Coca Cola and it was just down the block from the hotel. Great restaurants near by. We had a great time. Will be coming back to that hotel in the future.
Loved our stay here! Friendly staff always ready to greet you and help you. The bartender was great too. Down to earth and ready to mingle with customers. The facility was clean and well equipped. Would stay here again!
I have been here 2 years and am very happy with this hotel. The staff is great and accommodating. The kitchen is nice to have. If you need something long term and do not want to sign a lease choose Towneplace Suites Northlake.
"My husband stayed at the Omni for the night after a concert at a local venue. We enjoyed how close the hotel was to were we were heading for the concert. The staff was courteous, and the room was nice."
"I would have given this hotel 5 stars if not for one of the four nights I came back from meetings at 4 pm. and the room was cleaned yet.  Cooling was great, the room was very comfortable , staff was always friendly."
"I was greeted as an HHonors member which hasn't been very consistent with other properties recently. The property is well maintained and staff was friendly and helpful. This location couldn't be more convenient for dining, running, gyms."
I have stayed at this hotel several times during a quick trip to Atlanta! The staff is always great and helpful! They also are very good about accommodating honors members! Everything is walking distance around the hotel which was nice. Great Location!
"Excellent hotel.  Rooms (including bed and pillows) were outstanding, as was the service.  Requested additional bottled water and tea and it arrived in minutes.  Great location in the center of Buckhead."
extremely poor in every respect and now my visa card has been charged 0ver $2700.00 for a stay that I signed for at just $371.40. The hotel refuses to return my calls regarding close to $2300.00 in over charges. Just totally unbelieveable.
I found the service below average. the room was not ready when we arrived & we waited almost an hour.  the ice machine on our floor was not working. We were there 3 nights and remained broke. I just was not up to standards.
Room was spacious and well appointed. Very comfortable and clean. ES made my business trip a vacation. Staff very courteous and efficient. Complimentary breakfast was incredible. Would not think of staying anywhere else in Atlanta.
"Convenient to the airport, great staff, and great room service. Enjoyed the park and fly service an the return stay from our trip. Great shower after a long car ride to stay the night and then up early the next morning to fly out."
"Stayed here with family for dance convention at Merch Mart. Nice to have access without hitting the pavement, Enjoyed the Sun Dial restaurant... pricey, but great venue. Parking is a hassle, but they did a great job moving the vehicles along at a nice pace."
ItÃ¢ÂÂs always a lovely stay at Hyatt Place. The room layout is perfect for families or people who want a little bit of privacy. Hot breakfast is convenient and the staff is perfect. They make you feel right at home and important.
"It is very nice. The bathroom and room is very clean. The appliances are new and so is the bathroom. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are not too big, but has just enough room. I would recommend."
"Great location to walk to a good restaurant, Spondivits.   Easy access to/from highway.  Walking distance to Waffle House.  Staff is very friendly.  Small beverage and toiletries available by the front desk."
"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. There were so many restaurants that were in walking distance and shopping as well. If you are ever in the Atlanta area near Cumberland Mall, I would recommend this hotel!"
"This Hyatt is hidden in a quiet area of Atlanta, but still close to the Perimeter Mall and 285.  The rooms are quiet for a very popular hotel with hallways filled with guests.  General maintenance is well kept and reception desk was very helpful"
We really enjoy our stay & will be returning. The check in process was very easy & the staff was ver accommodating. The breakfast buffet was very delicious and many choices to choose from for food & beverages.
The King room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was very nice and well stocked with amenities. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend staying here for an travel in the downtown area.
We're so glad you decided to give our hotel a try - come see us again soon!
"Hotel was excellent good staff nice rooms, was in the middle of downtown, lots of restaurants and sights to see. Only downfall was parking. Had to park in offsite location about block from hotel was charged $20 for overnight. Need better parking solution."
"My husband and had a very nice experience at this hotel from check-in to check-out.  Everyone we encountered was very nice, professional, helpful and accommodating.  I would stay at this hotel again if I'm ever in the area."
Michelle is always nice when I come to the hotel which is everyday. She had a line of people from the airport and made everyone laugh. I appreciate that she gave everyone in line my flyer so they could order since their diner was closed.
I had one of the best hotel experience at the Ritz Carlton.  The hotel is awesome.  I enjoyed the service and the rooms are clean and the staff make someone feel welcome.  Downside though is the Guest parking is charged.
Very comfortable and close to amenities restaurants and places of interest.Pity the breakfast and parking were  not included. Staff very friendly. The airport was not too far away.Enjoyed the botanic gardens and Ponce Market.
"How awesome!  We're happy that you chose our hotel and that you enjoyed your first time visiting us! 

We're glad you took advantage of both our breakfast and social and that you were pleased with our offerings!

We look forward to seeing you again soon!"
The lobby is lovely and has a moderm design but the room itself could use upkeep. There were small details like crack in tub and bedroom dresser drawer handles loose or missing screws. Overall the staff was friendly and linens were clean and nice quality.
This hotel is very professional! The staff takes pride at their profession! It takes a special to serve others and is always willing to do so! Thanks for this wonderful experience....YOU GUYS SLAYED!Ã¢ÂÂº
My wife and I  enjoyed the privacy and the convenience that it gives. The room was very clean and we'll stocked with the nessesary accommodations. I will stay here again and I would recommend to  friends.
"Hotel is always top notch. Food and drinks are too expensive, but the mall is across the street. Service us always excellent from the front desk to hoysekeeoung, to the valet. Fitness room is convenient, as is their business office."
"If you fly into International terminal you take a shuttle to domestic.  Ask for directions.  About 25 minutes international to domestic. Then 5 minutes to hotel.  Very quick trip back to airport in AM.  Staff helpful, cheerful."
Nice modern hotel with easy access to midtown locations. Excellent service & doormen. Room was just fine. Unfortunately there isn't a club at this location. The restaurant in house was good. I would stay here again when having meetings in the area.
"This is really nice boutique hotel, with cozy rooms. I've stayed here twice and both times have been great. Valet is very prompt, the location is downtown and minutes from all of the attractions. I'm sure this won't be the last time I visit."
"We held a conference in ATL and the staff at HGI midtown were super helpful, cheerful, flexible, knowledgeable, and efficient.  We had a lot of changes and they were very gracious about accommodating them. We would definitely use them again!"
"This was a good hotel for the value.  The room was clean, bed comfortable and it's in a very good spot.  Ruth Crists in the lobby and Legal Seafood across the street are both excellent food choices.  We would stay here again."
"Nice hotel, very nice folks at check in. Plenty of restaurant choices near by, warm breakfast included more than adequate.  Breakfast area large enough to accommodate a pretty good crowd since we had a tour bus stop over."
"This is the best place in Atlanta to stay.  Top of the line service, great accommodation and comfort beyond compare.  Located near wonderful reastaraunts, Seasons 52' Fogo De Cho and Capital Grill. YOLO!"
We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us while in town for such a special occasion. I'm happy that the valet issue was addressed for you.
The rooms are large and clean. Great place to stay. Breakfast was a mad rush and they needed more workers to help maintain the demand. Greeted upon arrival and checked in straight away. The staff was friendly and ready to help in anyway possible.
Lobby very dated. Free breakfast isn't worth having. Great location but don't bring a car. Garage is horrible to park in and valet is always backed up. Staff only average. Not a good hotel compared to others around.
"Overall, I enjoyed the hotel a lot. The beds were comfy, rooms well-appointed, staff was friendly and helpful and it's in a great location by my favorite restaurant, Pappadeaux's. However, it's  mandatory valet parking now but booking.com said it was free."
"I have stayed at this hotel approximately 10 times, and I always receive excellent service.  The rooms are well-maintained.  The hotel's location is great -- restaurants and the Lenox mall are nearby.   I highly recommend this hotel."
Your business and your satisfaction is  most important  and we value you as our guest. Thanks
"From the lobby to my hotel room, the property is in good condition and the staff are friendly and attentive.  The restaurant, bar and sleeping rooms were all clean, organized and decorated well.  I'll be back and will stay here again."
We've stayed at this hotel for the past five years and will definitely return any time we're in Atlanta. Recent room renovations have only added to the superb service we have always received during our stays.
"We received wonderful service during our stay at Loews!  The rooms were beautiful, the food was very good and abundant, and the staff was gracious, kind and helpful. Jena went out of her way to give us guidance."
"Quiet comfortable  and friendly staff
Valet was awesome
Rooms were to die for
Beds were comfortable and clean
The bathroom was awesome with a walk in shower
The view was amazing everything was terrific"
"Just a one night stay to review but we found everything to our liking.  Friendiy staff, clean common areas and a very helpful door staff.  Our room was pleasant with plenty of living space and a clean feel and smell.  I recommend this Mid-town Hotel."
Not the cleanest Embassy Suites. It is convenient off of the highway. We did have some great employees help us. Our room was the allergy proof room. The only thing that seemed different was the air purifier in our room.
"Very noisy rooms.  I couldn't have the heating on because it was ridiculously noisy.  When next door used their sink it woke me up.  Got no rest.

Reception staff were very slow.

Limited room service menu.

I'm not impressed.  Very disappointed."
"Excellent service, Great food, good location.  Food was extremely pricey if you had to pay for it ($19.00 for a hamburger and fries), ( thankfully mine was paid forby my company )but very good."
"*The staff all around the hotel is wonderful.  They are always pleasant and accommodating. *Delicious breakfast. *Great location. *Clean rooms *Comfortable beds. *Cleaning service is tops. *No refrigerators in the rooms, but can request one. *Chairs/chaise are slightly dated."
Air conditioners in both elevators were not working. It was unbearably hot. The air conditioning  in the halls were also not working. Elevators were very slow. The halls were very hot. Food was over priced. Inadequate parking.  Stains on carpets.
"Had staff just unlock and walk into my room without knocking. Room was ok, not the most comfortable bed and the fridge didn't work. Convention facilities were good. Not the most handicapped friendly facility."
"Cool retro hotel, great location. Be  wary of the valet  fee. Breakfast offering was slim. Servers were very nice as was staff. Watch out for the 39 dollar valet fee. My room was only a hundred. Great location."
"We were looking forward to a weekend of luxury and Four Seasons did not disappoint in any way.  Everything I would expect was found in terms of rooms, service, spa, and restaurant with service and small amenities exceeding expectations."
"Check in is great and the front desk team is warm, friendly and accommodating. The room AC is inadequate.  There are several options for food but all the menus lack variety.  The gym bike was broken on my last stay and is still broken."
The lobby and managers reception is excellent.  The breakfast was outstanding.  The rest of the property is looking worn and dated with stained carpets.  Housekeeping staff did a nice job of keeping things clean.  Surprised at how small the TV in the room was.
"Your shuttle driver, Charles, was exceptional! He was such a nice gentleman who wanted only to help us. We had a lot of fun and were very thankful for his services. Job well done, Charles! He deserves a raise!"
"Thx. so much for your review. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay. Please come back again, soon!"
My best stay anywhere!!! I donÃ¢ÂÂt think I will stay anywhere else now that IÃ¢ÂÂve had a Westin experience!!!! The atmosphere was great!!!!!! The Sundial restaurant was to die for!!! The view of the city of Atlanta breathtaking!!!!!!
"The staff and managers were great. Both breakfast bar and breakfast items off the menu are recommended. The hotel room was clean, slept well and did not hear noises from other rooms. We did not have a chance to use the pool."
"Very good hotel, very clean, good amenities, no charges for Amazon packages, excellent breakfast, excellent services and employees, and perfect location at Atlanta. For sure I would stay again next time."
"Overall rating was good had a small problem but it was solved in a timely manner! I appreciate the attention that you all give me, in solving the issue that I had. Thank you so very much! Also for my card for the marketing."
This place was absolutely beautiful. The people that worked there were amazing. The breakfast was good and the courtyard was so comfortable. I will always try to stay when visiting Atlanta! It was very quaint and private.
"Yea, we are glad you will be back!  Thanks for the review of the hotel, we appreciate you taking the time to share.  We really do hope to see you back soon!"
Belene at the Restaurant in the hotel was awesome. A short two days stay and she remembered everything from what one prefers and when. Exceptional attention to detail and hospitality. The front desk staff at the hotel lobby was also very welcoming.
"Staff was great. The adjacent and connected Community Smith restaurant was good, with great staff. Room and bathroom was very clean. The guys taking care of arriving guests and valet parking were very helpful as well."
I am here for a long work stay.  Hotel is different than your standard hotel since it is in an older building in downtown. My room has huge sunny windows and has a loft feel to it.  Valet only parking here. Breakfast is adequate.
This property was awesome! The staff was very welcoming. The breakfast is absolutely amazing. I love staying at this property for events and when my travels. I would definitely recommend this property to everyone!
I held a Customer conference at the Doubletree and the Service was excellent and the Staff professional.  Our Event went off without a hitch and all left extremely satisfied.  I would highly recommend the Doubletree Atlanta to all.
Loved the mid century modern look of this hotel and how close it was to Suntrust park. My husband & I went to a concert and your SunTrust park in this hotel is the ideal location only a mile away. Our bed was super comfortable!
"This is a super hotel in a great location!  Super friendly staff, great rooms and very clean.  The mattress & pillows were awesome.  Would stay here again when visiting Atlanta."
We're so glad we could be of service during your stay! Thx. so much for being our guest. Please come back again when you can stay longer!
"Good location lots of restaurant, really clean rooms and lots of space. Only bad thing was the lady at the front desk she had an attitude and kinda of rude. Overall I recommend it. Price OK. Have to pay for parking 10$ e/a day."
"Went for a 3 days business trip. Centrally located, clean, quiet. Extremely friendly staff which competently resolved any issues. I did not have breakfast at, based on others Travellers reviews, but there are plenty of caffes around within minutes of walk. I'd surely return to."
Traveled on business and thought that this hotel was outstanding. I would look no further and book your stay! The staff was exceptional and the room was fantastic. There is a Whole Foods across the street if you need some health snacks.
"This is a great location, north of downtown Atlanta. This is an area within blocks of the mall, public transportation (rail), an assortment of restaurants and other businesses.  Plus, the hotel provided transportation.  There were several Fam Reunions going on. We really enjoyed the stay."
"very close to airport nice service has valet, very quiet inside the hotel for how close it is in proximity to airport, and three highways. Staff was very friendly and pleasant to talk to. Definitely will stay again."
"Very nice property in a good location.  Close to all of downtown ATL. Modern rooms, the staff was great, front desk, bell men, waitresses all were friendly and made us feel welcome.  Will definitely will stay there again."
I was staying for my birthday and my wife asked them to surprise me with chocolate covered strawberries. The staff went above and beyond to make my day even better. Thank you to the staff and my wife.
"This hotel was great. The rooms are huge and very clean. The restaurant has good food. Free wi-fi and wine and chocolates when you get to your room. Very quiet hotel.

Only thing...know where you are because no cab driver knew where this hotel was."
"This is a beautiful hotel featuring large, comfortable rooms, nice public spaces, a fine fitness center/spa and an excellent restaurant and bar. Service is truly exceptional, with a genuine focus on guests.

I will certainly return."
Was very clean and nice.  Wish I could have stayed longer. Big comfy bed.  Walking distance to a number of bars and restaurants.  Easy to find.  Would definitely stay there again in the future.  No complaints at all.
"When staying near an interstate you always wonder how noisy the hotel is going to be, but this one is nothing but quiet. Very comfortable bed and room. Everything we needed, and got a pretty good deal on a Friday night through Priceline."
Excellent accommodations and service!  The bed was very comfortable and the room was very roomy.  Service from the front desk and shuttle driver was excellent. Having the free shuttle to take passengers up to 5 miles is a BIG plus!
"Love the property, great location near several restaurants & not far from town area, great and welcoming staff. They went above & beyond to make our stay comfortable. Would recommend this property to anyone. You will love it!!"
"It is a little pricey but worth it if you are going to the stadium. Walking distance to anything you want.  Got in and out of stadium and back to room within minutes.
The pool area is awesome with a fully staffed bar!!"
"First stay was a nightmare, slow check in. Manager seemed a mess and overwhelmed. needles were found in room. Front desk tried to overlook it and say whatever to get me out the door. Weed smell everywhere. Avoid this hotel at all  cost.... Poor"
"The Hyatt Villa Christina is a lovely hotel.  The guest rooms are fresh and nicely appointed.  The bathroom in my suite was quite remarkable!!  The staff is welcoming and helpful, and the food in the restaurant is wonderful.  Try the Sunday Brunch!!"
"The Hotel was relatively close to the school.  Central location from school, Buckhead and the Lenox mall.  Large rooms and nice gym.  There was no free breakfast, which would have been a plus, but the rooms had a refrigerator."
Very good stay but price was misrepresented!  But the overall service was very acceptable.  I found the room service was excellent & staff was extremely friendly & always willing to meet my every needs.
"Relaxing atmosphere, good food, phenomenal staff.  I recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit the Atlanta area, but not be right downtown.  A normal drive to midtown ATL took no more than 15-20 minutes - which was perfect - even in heavy traffic."
"The hotel was a very good value.  During the Superbowl, it felt like a party.  The staff worked hard to make us comfortable.  It was in the international flight path. but the noise was reasonable, and I did not hear it the second night."
"Whenever I go to Atlanta, I always stay here.  Instead of a mere hotel room, it's a fabulous luxurious apartment with a balcony.  Beautiful, modern, sparkling clean. Comfy bed. Staff is friendly, courteous, & prompt with service.  Food is very good at their ""Room"" restaurant."
"We are glad to hear that you adored our hotel and found the courtyard a great place to enjoy a drink at night.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thanks"
"While the common areas of this hotel could use some continued updating & renovating, the rooms were absolutely wonderful! Spacious, beautiful, comfortable, & clean! Amenities & location were great & staff was extremely pleasant!"
"We truly value your comments and appreciate that you enjoyed our unique style and enjoyed the hotel amenities.  We look forward to having you stay with us again very soon.

Thanks"
"My apologies about the events that led to your dissatisfaction, anything less than excellence is failure for us. We will continue to strive for this, thanks for your candid review."
"Compared to other hotels, this one does not live up to the the InterContinental brand. You can see the age, and it needs a complete update. Not going to repeat this hotel. One night was more than enough."
Had to visit with our teacher conference. Absolutely fabulous place. Loved the programs and students. Do not like that itÃ¢ÂÂs in the heart of the city. Only drawback. Wish it was a little more outside of the city.
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a night on our way to Nashville, the staff is very nice, they offer nuts and water at arrival, check in was very fast. The hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable."
"Updated rooms are really nice and comfortable. For the price however, the evening reception should have more quality beverages and snacks. Overall nice comfortable place to stay for my business needs."
"Shout out to SHAKIL and TIFFANY. The hotel did a great job on their renovations. We ran into a few problems during this week long stay but Shakil and Tiffany did a great job getting things fixed and made us feel very comfortable, THANKS!"
"Our family loved our stay, very clean and staff was so kind!  Would definitely stay again!  Room was clean, loved the body wash!  Beds were super comfortable and view was very pretty!  Lobby was so cool, very modern."
"It was a very good stay. We only had a overnight stay on a Friday night. I was pleasantly surprised at the breakfasts offerings as it had a variety of cereals, eggs (scrambled, boiled), bacon, sausage, hot cooked oatmeal and french toast."
"This hotel has everything you could want, including a great midtown location.  Service was excellent, staff was courteous & attentive, room had all the comforts. Be prepared for pricey parking, though."
"The stay was great I we were very disappointed that the resturant was not rotating, it was the main reasons we chose to stay there. The food was good but our daughter was bored because it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt spinning which impacted our enjoyment"
Great hotel experience.  Very convenient to Suntrust Park with a free shuttle to the game.  Great value and price point compared to other hotels.  Not a large hotel.  Just comfy and cozy for our needs.  Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.
Omg my stay at the wyndham was wonderful I can't complain and I won't complain.. the Staff was oh my goodness so friendly n warm.. real southern hospitality... thanks Wadeeya Ruth Kenny n Mike you guys are awesome..
It was nice and quiet up on the club floor. The room was spacious and very clean. I was traveling for business and the restaurant area has a nice area to meet with work associates. Staff was friendly.
"Two night stay for work.  Nice hotel with friendly staff. Adjoining restaurant is very good.  Several restaurants walkable.  Fast valet.  Decent gym.  Near GA Tech.  No concierge lounge, but did offer breakfast coupons."
I only stayed one night but that was GREAT! The room was clean and the bed way sooo comfortable. The rain shower head was awesome. Not to mention the front desk staff was extremely friendly and efficient.
"Overall hotel was nice, noise level outside of room was loud due to other people's doors slamming, talking in hall etc.  Our particular room had some sort of buzzing noise every 10 minutes or so, figured it was some sort of mechanical issue."
"The only problem I had with the hotel was you had to pay for everything offered at the note, which was the breakfast the microwave and fridge if you wanted it,but I slept well and the hotel was nice.."
"Excellent staff. Abdul was especially helpful in directing us towards great restaurant and always had a smile on his face. 
The other staff was just as gracious, courteous and resourceful. 
I would recommend this hotel."
"During our annual conference, the GTHCC staff did a fabulous job of taking care of us. It was extremely helpful to even have them anticipate our needs. Excellent job done by all; special thanks to Yolanda, John, Eliana, and Almaz."
"This location has an executive lounge overlooking the airport runways, room was clean and nicely appointed.  Upgrades are planned for the fall.  Location is a bit isolated so dining choice is only in the hotel."
Great hotel and close to SunTrust ballpark. Shuttle service to the game is a plus. Elizabeth is very helpful and professional. Great staff and will return to this location when I return to Atlanta. Great location.
"Thx. so much for your comments. We're very sorry about your shower experience and have let our team know. Thx. for bringing to our attention. So glad you were able to enjoy your stay otherwise. Please come back again, soon!"
"Asked for fridge never got it many problems but not gonna discuss. Jjdhncnnndndjsjndnbdndjndbhchdndhdjnsbdjsndghdhdjdhdhhddjnshdhsjdjsjdjdhdhdjdndhdhjekssueyeydhndjsjxhdhdhdmtr.,,.,,khdghjjggdddddddjhcgdbejjsh"
Oh my goodness - I'm dismayed to read of your experience!  I'm so sorry you encountered so many issues.  Please contact me directly at 404-876-8888 so that I may properly address your concerns.
"Loved staying here. Was in Atlanta for a week working. My stay at Embassy Suites was excellent. Room was huge and comfy, great service. Great view of park, hotel is in the heart of downtown Atlanta. Loved it!"
Very disappointed that I was not upgraded as a Platinum Preferred member.  Internet didnÃ¢ÂÂt work well the first day and required multiple calls.  I donÃ¢ÂÂt recommend this property.  The phone operator was polite.
Rooms were great. Phipps Plaza is a one minute walk from the Hotel. No streets to cross. Jaquay W and Anaya R were very helpful. Our room had a nice view of downtown Atlanta. Room were spacious and very clean.
"Very comfortable room and location was perfect .  The hotel
Was booked and I was leaving and the girl came out and stopped me and said they had a cancellation.   The room was very clean."
Located right next to downtown. Within walking distance to the Atlanta haws and the Atlanta Falcons stadiums and several other attractions. It has valet service. The hotel rooms are very private you can only reach your room by inserting a key into the elevator.
Between the cable and telephone..I was surprised that the Hyatt had issues with the telephone and cable. I used the phone and it was dead air for a minute before it dialed out. The cable had digital and analog channels...But the staff was great!
Nice stay while at a very well attended conference.  Branding of conference was all over.  Convenient downtown location that was near several venues.  Hotel was clean and room was comfortable.  Very welcoming.
"Only stayed one night for a graduation, but will def come back for a longer stay. Great location, and love the modern look. The beds were very comfortable, and the Brita water and communal are on each floor is a nice touch too!"
"Excellent hotel for short stays only because of the lack of nearby restaurants/stores.  Great service, though. The airport shuttle was effortless...right there when we followed the shuttle signs at the airport. From plane to room was only about 20 minutes."
"I really liked the hotel and would stay there again and again, and recommend to my friends. The lobby is nice and the staff is great. The room was comfortable adn the breakfast was tasty and fresh, although a little slow."
I asked about a possibility of a government rate upon check in and the clerk was unable to help me. Only stated that he could give me a number to call to ask someone thats not even there.
"ItÃ¢ÂÂs a pleasure to know that you enjoyed your stay with us, including our terrific accommodations and wonderful location. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Atlanta Marriott Buckhead Hotel & Conference Center soon!"
"I am definitely returning to this location on my next visit to Atlanta...wonderful staff, immaculate rooms, very quiet, and peaceful stay."
The rooms were very nice. In my opinion I think every room should have a microwave and refrigerator. The beds were very comfortable.
"My mom and I stayed here and loved it!! Beautiful lobby, super friendly and helpful staff, and our suite room was awesome! It was huge for a hotel room and gave us plenty of space to spread out! Awesome location! Definitely would stay here again!"
We are terribly sorry to hear about your recent experience with us. Please feel free to reach out to a manager regarding your stay. We hope you will accept our apologies and stay with us again.
There were finger nail clippings on the floor and bed. The carpet wasn't vacuumed and the tile floors were never cleaned. They never replenished the room on the second day. Valet took thirty minutes to locate our car.
I have been to the Emory Conference Center Hotel over many years for my CME conferences.  The quality of services and the hotel itself were always without fault.  I look forward to my next year's visit.
Great hotel with large suites if you have business in the area between the city and Marietta. It is right by Cumberland mall (which has some nice restaurants) and some strip malls. The staff is very helpsome and friendly.
"The staff greet you warmly, every day both coming and going. Room is cleaned and restocked daily as if it is your first day. They don't miss a thing, even cleaning my tub daily. #impressive and #appreciated!"
Rooms were very spacious. The staff was friendly and helpful. It was conveniently located near the airport so drivers into town were easily accessible. We always look for Hyatt place while traveling. Cannot go wrong for the value.
Great location if you want to be close to shopping.  Friendly and attentive staff.  Nicely appointed Hotel.  Only disappointment was the Sunday Brunch was scaled back from what I remember previously because of renovations of the restaurant
My daughters wedding was held there.  And it was superb!  They had a garden wedding and everything was setup so nicely.  The reception was fabulous.  I would recommend this venue to anyone who's planning a special event.
"Excellent location near the airport, very clean and quiet hotel. I love there is a restaurant within the hotel with good food and bar nearby. Large pool area. TWO THUMBS UP...I would recommend the hotel."
The hotel is beautiful and is located in a great area with many things to do. The restaraunt on site is wonderful. The staff were very pleasant and accommodating. IÃ¢ÂÂd recommend staying at the Georgian Terrace.
My friend and i had a solid  night last night at the bar. Our server was on point the whole time. Kibe was very attentive and made great drink suggestions. The drinks themselves were delicious but a little expensive.
Stayed here for the Peachtree Road Race...great location and comfy beds! The outdoor pool was a huge hit with friends and family.  Just wished breakfast was available till 11am instead of 10am. We will be back next year!
"We went to the Loews for our anniversary and they provided a wonderful experience from the quality of the room, in-room service, and valet/door service. I highly recommend staying here for any special occasion or to take advantage of Midtown Atlanta."
My husband spend a lot of time traveling.  Hyatthouse is one of the very BEST! Put it in our address listing to always come back to this particular one. It is also in walking distance of the Cobb Energy Center.
"Loved the spacious 2 bedroom suite. Would definitely stay here again. Great value for the money. Super comfortable and clean. Close to airport, 10 mins from downtown. Great selection of restaurants nearby."
"Friendliness of staff, they were courteous and patient.ard to accommodate everyone. Valet & bell service patient & excellent service with the high demand of traffic coming in at the same time and they were in between shift change"
"Stayed here over Thanksgiving and found it very convenient to our family and comfortable to stay in. Bed refreshed every day with a new comforter, I think- a pretty special touch.  Recommend highly and will plan to stay here whenever needing a hotel in Atlanta."
We love hearing great comments such as yours! Thank you Fayesonja.
"One of the nicest hotels I have been in.  Loved the views from every angle.  Pool was very nice and my family had a great time.
 Awesome hotel!!!!! Will stay again when we are back in Atlanta.   Thanks so much."
The hotel has a nice bar and restaurant area. We got in late and it was great that they serve food until midnight in the restaurant. Very convenient to airport shuttle. Rooms were typical but very clean. I would stay again.
"The hotel needs an update especially the room bathrooms. The tub/ shower was dirty and there were rust spots. Staff was friendly however, and check in and check out was quick and efficient. The breakfast was decent, and early check in was available."
I checked into my room and settled in but the TV was not working. The front desk urgently sent up the hotel engineer- Ralph.  Ralph was able to quickly assist to ensure my stay was comfortable.  I would recommend this hotel and stay here again.
This is not your typical Marriott.  It seems old and now is just a mess. We asked for a king but were told none were available. The elevators took a long time. The pool was not inviting and the room really needed a renovation.
"My friends and I had an amazing trip for NYE 2018 and had an exceptional experience at the Doubletree Hotel I'd definitely lodge there again the room, staff, facility etc were superb to our taste quality and standards"
"Hope your son's audition went well. Glad that the stay was great, you can count on us for making you feel special through hosting you brilliantly. Please come back soom, thanks very much for traveling."
"Wonderful hotel in a great location - good amenities. Internet was stable, the bed was comfortable and the mini kitchen was well stocked with teas and coffees. The shower head was pretty cool. Right across the street from side entrance fourth floor Of convention center."
"We were very impressed with the hotel and it is especially well-suited to business travelers in Downtown Atlanta.  The rooms were exceptionally clean, the beds very comfortable, and the staff was friendly and attentive.  I would definitely stay there on future trips!"
"Hotel is very nice, clean and dog friendly. Staff is very nice. Drinks and food in bar and room service was good quality. Dogs were allowed in bar area and very nice and convenient park area across the street."
"Over the last 90 days I have stayed at this hotel 8 times. The service, staff and ambience is outstanding. 

It is also convenient - you can walk to nearby shopping and a number of restaurants.

The rooms are spacious and well furnished."
We love everything about you. The eclectic experience and unique design make W Atlanta-Buckhead an unmistakable destination to have fun.
I stayed here on business this week. The room was exactly what I'd expect from the Aloft brand. My team also reserved one of their meeting rooms and it worked great to have the big monitor to project as well as a whiteboard.
Ellis is a great option to all the run of the mill brand big box hotels. If you like boutique hotels that stand out as an experience rather than a boring place to spend an evening...try this unique hotel.
"excellent.  However, the bringing out food at restaurant took 1 hour.  We thought that could be a little less time considering we and a few other groups were the only guests in restaurant on third floor."
"Nice hotel, great staff, great location (perfect place to stay for Braves ball games, just a very short walk) Quiet rooms, up to date amenities, clean, staff very friendly and helpful, comfortable beds"
"I usually stay at this property 3-4 times annually.  The rooms have always been clean and comfortable. Ms. Robin and Ms. Connie, who worked in the dining room, were absolutely wonderful.  They made us feel at home."
"The valet and front desk staff are exceptional in all my travels I have never experienced such a dedicated group. They always step up with help and assistance, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs giving directions or ordering an Uber"
"I have stayed at this property before.  Older Hotel, just remodeled.. looks Great.. still have the same friendly staff. Nice Breakfast. Nice Rooms. Several good places to eat near by. Near Interstate, Near Emory Hospital."
The stay at the hotel was beyond imagination.The Atmosphere and the choice of food at the restaurants was diverse and we enjoyed the food.The rooms were nicely done and the beddings were super comfortable.
This property needs to be renovated. Very old and dirty rooms. No connection to lobby for breakfast and evening receptions from the rooms. The staff is one of the friendliest we had come across recently. Always at the ready and smiling.
"The room was magnificent, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Price below what you might expect for the location and room type.  Parking garage was unusual aspect of hotel, but price was fair for that as well.  We will return"
A very good property that was located near the event we needed to attend. Helpful and courteous staff. The room was clean and bed was very comfortable. I would recommend this property to anyone that needs to stay near the Galeria area.
"Clean accommodations. Nice selection for breakfast.  The location is good, and the free shuttle to/from the airport is a big plus.  I would definitely stay here again, and will recommend this location to others."
We stayed at the hotel for a wedding. Hotel is in a great location with shuttle service. We were transported to a restaurant for breakfast and to the mall. Room was spacious with a view of the gardens.
"We appreciate the candid response, glad the hotel and location met your needs. We look forward to your return, thanks for traveling and thanks for choosing Marriott Midtown."
My wife and I stayed here overnight in route to our vacation destination. Transportation from the airport was easy and runs every 20 minutes. The hotel was large and clean with no surprises. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.
"Best place for DragonCon-- near the action, but still quiet at night.  The staff is fabulous-- attentive and helpful.  All of the Hyatt hospitality without the fuss.  Free breakfast is the best in the business.  Lots of high protein options."
Honeymoon was great service was great clean room food was great valet parking was very friendly nice and quiet this was in a great area there were stores near by several places inside the hotel would recommend
"We only stayed a night and it was an ideal place. Good reception,easy parking,large rooms. Good outdoor pool. Cumberland mall is close for shopping and a choice of restaurant. Cooked breakfast available from 6.00 am was ideal for an early start."
"Our waitress, Kibe, made the experience a pleasure - we're definitely looking forward to coming back soon - great service, some of the tastiest drinks around the Atlanta area, admirable atmosphere, overall would recommend"
"Thx. so much for your review. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay in Buckhead, and that you could take advantage of our Grand Club and our great neighborhood. Hope you can stay with us again, soon!"
"Great location, close to Marta, restaurants, & bars. Comfortable room, but my wife would have liked a makeup mirror. Cordial front desk staff and hotel bartender. Valet service was prompt with our car both times we needed it during our stay."
Berry clean and comfortable! They are kid friendly! Valet parking is expensive but hotel location is convenient! We will book here again! Bathrooms clean and bed comfortable! Nice atmosphere! Staff friendly!
"Overall it was a comfortable room.  However, several things should have been better
1.  There was food in the microwave
2.  There was mold in the shower
3.  Parking was challenging in the evening
4.  Given the prices, there should be elevators"
Ok not great .didn't clean the rooms. Had to ask for towels. Only good thing was thing was the customer service. He valet attendants were great...The location was good to get to everything in Atlanta.
Our experience at the hotel was excellent based on the customer service we were given at the front desk and the shuttle to and from the Braves stadium.  The hotel is conveniently located to the Atlanta Braves stadium and the shuttle services is a plus.
This was my first time at this location and I loved it !! We will definitely be going back really soon ! The hotel was beautiful the food was great and the staff that we did see was awesome Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ½
Ongoing renovations make for a noisy and unpleasant stay. Hallways are dark and dank. Room had an unpleasant odor. Ice machines were broken on several floors. One of the elevators was out-of-order. I would not recommend this hotel.
"Good location, value and room. Easy to get to and close to great restaurants and bars. The room was spacious, updated, and clean. The staff was pleasant. Good pick for the area and the bank account. Recommend."
"We feel our pricing is in line with similar properties in this area and we feel that we offer good value given our location and facilities. However, in your case it appears we failed to meet expectations, and for that I am truly sorry."
"Accomodating staff, rooms average, bathroom nice, bar & breakfast ok, berakfast good, east side of hotel nosiy (fire station 24x7 & hospitals close); decent weekend rates, would recommend staying here; within walking of severasl restaurants & shopping."
Stayed while dragoncon was happening downtown. Everything about the hotel was great except the price. This was expected since it was so close to The events. the parking is always high at $25. But again the locaton is great.
Stay here only if you don't have any other alternatives.  Front desk needs a complete overhaul. Most of them are not friendly and the treatment is not what you expect from a decent hotel. There are much better Hyatt properties you can find.
Outstanding service from start to finish ...fantastic room service burgers. Clean facilities and nice location. What more could you ask for? Frankly it exceeded my expectations. Most noteworthy were the front desk staff who seems genuinely pleased to welcome you.
Great location and friendly staff.  Enjoyed the stay a lot. The rooms were a little small but the location incredible.  We totally enjoyed the space and location. While we weren't visiting Suntrust Park the amenities in the area make it a great place to stay.
"Room was nice, very clean. Check in desk was average. Concierge was very helpful. Very convenient catching cab to the airport in the early morning, bell hops were very helpful. Would definately recommend."
"We stay here every visit to Atlanta because hotel close to family. But though there are many other hotels in the area, we continue to stay only here. Great rooms, staff, location, convenience and at a reasonable price."
"Poor Service, Even after requesting for housekeeping, it was not done properly, No housekeeping on few days of the week. some of the suites are way inside. Breakfast is having limited options. Overall OK."
"My room was extremely comfortable and well equipped, the bed was the most comfortable I've stayed at in a hotel. Lovely pool, great food, adequate gym, and the staff were so helpful...I would most definitely stay here again!!"
"All of the staff members went above and beyond to make our experience a memorable one. From the bell hop to the concierge service, everything was First Class! Perfect location and a beautiful place to stay!"
Amazing hotel. Stayed at hotel while touring Emory. We arrived Easter Sunday . Service was amazing. Restaurant was wonderful. Would stay again. Everyone that worked at hotel went above and beyond. Beautiful grounds and wonderful rooms.
"This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel-I stay for work purposes-and each time I am pleased with all aspects of my stay.  Great staff, great value, great breakfast! I can recommend it highly for business or pleasure."
"The reception staff were attentive and after a long flight from London, gave us two complimentary drinks vouchers to use at the bar. The hotel room was clean and a good size and the cost was reasonable for an overnight stay."
"I visited for a business for a few days. Sat at the bar with Luciano and he was so fun, and energetic. He kept the bar clean and he was very professional. Service was prompt and accurate. And the prices were decent. Will definitely return."
Hotel was very easy to get to from the airport. You took the skytrain over and got off right across the street. The staff was great and very helpful to explain the area.the hotel was quiet and the rooms were clean.
"The property's layout is a little different from a traditional hotel. Takes a little time getting used to. Guestrooms are in need of a refresh, but overall very nice, comfortable surroundings. Breakfast was good not great. The value is excellent, making it worth price."
"Still a great property if you can look past the current ongoing renovations. Also, check out Bliss spa for $99 monthly you get unlimited access to the spa area and an included facial or massage each month."
I work with hundreds of hotels across the southeast and this hotel is by far one of my favorites.  The rooms are always immaculate and the staff is second to none!  I highly recommend this hotel to any traveller whether it's for leisure or business!
"Front desk all the way to the hotel driver were very professional. Although I was not offered a cookie at check in, I did eventually get my cookie later on. I will most likely stay here again if travel permits."
"Good location for business and night time dining all within walking distance  
Hotel offered shuttle service which was convenient 
Great for a business traveler with business king rooms
Starbucks coffee
Meeting space as well"
"Blown away by lay out of hotel. Happy hour and made to order breakfast are definite perks. This will be my go to hotel if in the area. 

Front desk staff really really nice and we were given an upgraded room."
"Best hotel and staff ever.   Every one at the hotel is very attentive, and enjoys their job.   Cudos to Hunter and Brian for making my stay beyond expectations.    They both went out of their way to make me feel at home."
I enjoyed this location because it allowed you to have a wonderful dinner on site and not have to leave the hotel for ANYTHING.... The staff was great inviting and was very attentive to your individual needs.
"Great property; well trained and happy employees. Staff is 6 star for service, great breakfast (fresh) and evening food Mon-Wed is great. Great option for a short or long stay in the Perimeter Mall area."
"Very friendly and helpful staff, especially Kimberley and Ean.  We really enjoyed taking the shuttle to dinner.  Breakfast was good but pricey.  The guest room needed an update but the bed was comfortable.  The clock and the coffee pot didnÃ¢ÂÂt work."
I loved the location and the view.  It put us exactly where we needed to be.  The staff was very friendly and that made it easy to ask for assistance with the area as well.  I would definitely refer friends to this hotel.
My stay was excellent. Rooms are a cozy size. The staff was absolutely amazing! Friendly and kind during every encounter. The location is wonderful and central to almost everything. Just a wonderful experience and I would surely recommend and/or stay again!
Hotel was clean and the room were the quietest hotel room we have stayed in - would return to this in the future.  Check-in staff was friendly and helpful.  Courtesy shuttle rocked!  Convienant to Lenox Square and great restaurants.
Thx. so much for your review. We've passed your comments on to our team. We're so sorry you did not enjoy your room service experience with us. We apologize for any inconvenience. We hope you'll come back and stay with us again.
"Came there for a nearby convention, hotel is nice, great staff and the rooms are large and bed was comfortable. I would recommend staying here if it's for business or leisure travel, close to the airport as well."
"In the heart of the downtown/ Centennial Park area. Close to the Mercedes Arena and other popular Downtown Atlanta attractions.
Valet Parking a little pricey at $40 per day. Did not get to try Ruth's Chris room service as they had closed early."
Amenities and rooms were good!! Good for staying for a night to catch flight next day. Convenient travel options from here to airport and the other way like buses from the airport. Comfortable beds and spacious rooms.
I stayed at the hotel for the first time.   I was upgraded to a beautiful suite (IÃ¢ÂÂm a member of iPrefer rewards).  It was a real suite with separate rooms and a kitchen.  Very very nice.  Will definitely stay here again.
"I always experience ""excellence"" here EMBASSY is the BEST! I love the Complimentary Breakfast always FRESH! Made to order. (some Items e.g. Omelets, Eggs and breakfast meat. I will recommend this for your stay in the GEORGIA (College Park) area"
"Very surprised to find a great hotel under $120 for a Saturday night! I would stay there again even if I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt stuck at the airport! The room was quiet, beds super comfy, room was ultra modern, food and service at the restaurant was great!"
I'm in the military and wanted to relax for the first weekend of my leave period. The accommodations exceeded expectations. My favorite part would have to be the jacuzzi tub. I spent hours soaking my worries away. Plan on visiting again for another relaxing weekend
"Every one at this Hotel is great 
They care and you always at home when you stay at this Hotel. I will stay at this restaurant time after time. The Manager always is ready to help you in any aspect.  Good breakfast"
"Brand new and in a very good location , all restaurants and bars or cafÃÂ¨s are walkable from here and adjacent to a MARTA station . 
Stylish and high quality rooms and very welcoming staff.
I stayed here for business and would highly recommend."
"Average rooms, not fancy, relatively clean but not perfect, think just below hampton inn or marriott suites. The rooms seemed dated. Charged extra for parking. Staff was friendly. Great location, great public spaces with large areas well decorated"
I went there in June for the Blade Show.  Not having a free Internet access during a business trip certainly lowers the mark. On the bright side the restaurant and the bed (and bedding) met my expectations whereas the staff exceeded the highest standards.
I was there on business and was pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff.  All areas were clean and neat.  I was greeted with an hello and a smile.  The price was not bad and the rooms are comfortable.
"We stayed here in January while visiting family in Atlanta.
The hotel was very nice, the room was clean and beautiful with a nice view, and the rates were reasonable given the quality.
Would definitely stay there again!"
"The embassy suites at the Atlanta airport has a great modern decor throughout the hotel.  There are plenty of areas to have a group or private discussions.  The staff is polite and attentive.  Also, the evening reception and quality of food is noteworthy"
"Love staying here for the nice rooms, stocked kitchens and walking distance to everything downtown.  The only complaint is the free breakfast.  Skip it, sleep a little longer and grab a bagel somewhere else and you'll feel more satisfied."
Lovely hotel. Queen Suite was very clean and had a nice view from the 8th floor. Very convenient location as the of Sun Trust ballpark was nearby with plenty of restaurants/hang out locations. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.
Please explore your options before making your reservation at the Hotel. The rooms are old and the carpet and bathrooms need some updating. This Hotel lost power on several occasions and they have no generator.
"Keycards never worked, wallet was stolen from room -- and Housekeeping let someone without a key in our room. Also pulling the room completely closed required two people. Management unfriendly and unwilling to assist. Basically told it was my fault. Not a recommended hotel."
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in a 2 bedroom suite.  The staff was very accommodating and the hotel is within easy walking distance of restaurants and other activities.  It is very convenient to the Atlanta Symphony Hall.
This is one of the nicest Hotel close by the Atlanta Airport. Staff was very friendly and the room was spotless. Facilities was excellent and the Free breakfast was great. nice workout facilities also.
Enjoyed staying in the hotel. Breakfast was good & lived the omelet bar.  The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. You can tell this hotel caters to the business travelers. I would stay here again if visiting Atlanta again.
"Excellent hotel , Upon arrival we were warmly welcome by the friendly reception ( Marika) She makes our trip more interesting with her advices & tips bout the city ... Would recommend this hotel to everybody!!!!!"
"It was a very pleasant experience. It was first time staying in Hyatt House; I had previously stayed in Hyatt Grand and Hyatt Regency, et al. Hyatt House is different and my kind of place due to the kitchen and homely experience. Everything was good."
"The Glenn was simply beautiful! We loved the ambience of it, the overall feel was so inviting and beautiful. We stayed for a concert at The Tabernacle which was in walking distance. We will definitely be staying here again."
"Close to everything , front desk lady awful , rest of staff polite and helpfull. Nice grounds and pool , hot tub , amenities. Wife was happy as lots of shopping rest close by and close to highway entrance."
"Wonderful hotel with great hospitality. All the staff I encountered were polite, smiled and ready to assist. 

Though IÃ¢ÂÂve stayed at this location several times before I had never tried the spa. That was something I should have done years ago. The services were devine!"
This was a good newly renovated place. It has modern decor. It has a cute indoor/outdoor pool area. It is in a decent part of town. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I will stay there again next time I'm in Atlanta.
"The front desk receptionist was exceptional!! Professional, courteous, knowledgeable and the type of person you would expect in such a position.  She enhanced my stay!!  The room was modern, clean and quite relaxing.  Wish I had stayed longer!!"
"So  the room was a bit dank and could use a touch up. But the people were nice, and what do you expect by the airport? A good place to stop overnight. Catch the shuttle and you get a week free parking while you're gone."
There was a crying baby that could be heard.....you could  hear right outside the door ...to the bathroom ...and the rear facing window had some random noise all night... besides the garbage trucks dropping the dumpster
This property is wonderful and filled with dedicated and helpful staff.  I stay here frequently to enjoy the consistent Embassy Suites value  and have found the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful.
"I believe all rooms are suites, mine was.  It is a great location for seeing a show at The Fox Theater, going to Mercedes-Benz stadium.  The downstairs bar (P&P) is the hidden gem...signature cocktails and the apps are fantastic...the chicken & waffles is awesome!"
Thx. so much for your review and for being our guest. We're so glad to hear you enjoyed our Onyx Lobby bar (both early and late!)! Please come back and stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead.
"This was the first time staying in a hotel like Homewood Suites.  The whole place was beautiful and well kept and the suites were just as wonderful.  Very clean and quiet too, I felt right at home.  Would stay again the next time around."
"Not a bad airport hotel .. it's off the airport a little but they run regular shuttle services 

Rooms were very nice and quiet 

Had dinner in the downstairs sports bar which was ok .. nothing great about it"
"Amazing service from Arrival to Departure, Every detail was perfect and the rooms were clean and attended to twice a day or more depending on need. Every employee wanted you to have the best stay possible!!"
"Selected hotel because conference was being held there. Conference room were very warm, unexpected.  Suites were clean, comfortable. Great location. Made to order breakfast was terrific. Didn't really participate in evening reception but others enjoyed it."
"Everything was excellent about this place. Great staff, clean rooms, large rooms, good food, great location etc. The only complaint I have is our room smelled horrific and nothing made it go away. Will definitely come again."
"Staff was fantastic from check-in, to bar staff, to valet everyone seemed interested in making sure that guests were taken care of. 

The building itself is a uniquely renovated/ repurposed office building."
This hotel is one of those special places where you feel like you are at home.  The staff is exceptional and they make you feel like family. Spa could use some work to get it up to level of other Mandarin Hotels.
"I love the new AC Brand.  Modern yet comfortable. Thanks for a great stay. Wonderful service, clean, great location to area shopping and businesses with shuttle service everyday.  Can't wait to come back and bring the husband."
Cost of parking is very expensive   Hotel shuttle service dropped off and picked up at many popular locations.  I expected the room to be larger.  Great location if you ar e on a business trio  on or near Peachtree Road.   Near major shopping Center
"Adequate for business but nothing special.  Need better breakfast offerings at better price, such as turkey or chicken sausage.   Valet parking only and service a bit slow.  Convenient location off Cobb near Cumberland."
"With the exception of one staff member in club level dining, the hotel and those who run it are top notch!  We had a great time and would return again!  With hurricane Irma, they had a full house but treated all with kindness."
"To say the less, this place is at the best of the best of Atlanta, thank you for a great stay, for a great service....staff is very professional, I really thank you for the service to my family, to all, thank you."
We had a great week stay at this hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a high end stay. Location Location Location. Room was great. Service was spot on. Every need was taking care. My wife had massage and she like it.
"The bed in the room was really nice for good sleeping. The room was bright, clean and spacious. The hotel is conveniently Located very close to restaurants and a shopping mall. Will go back again next year."
They have NO sense of customer service. I am using my experience in a Business Case Study. This hotel makes it their policy to intercept any incoming call without immediately putting it through to you
I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for a business meeting.  The aesthetic is appealing and inviting.  The staff was professional and upbeat from the valet to check out.  Everyone made sure that we had everything that we needed.  I would definitely stay again.
"We're very happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and appreciate all of your compliments on our hotel and we hope to welcome you back very soon!

Patrick Palmer, CHA, General Manager"
"We look forward to your next stay at your ""home away from home""!"
"We had a business meeting Friday to Sunday and this hotel was delightful for an extremely friendly and helpful staff from reception to restaurant to sales to management.  Wow!  Room was nicely appointed with nice amenities.   Nice room, nice bathroom."
"Beautiful, comfortable, hip, modern, friendly service, great location near shops and bars.  everything about my stay was perfect!"
"I would definitely recommend this property to anyone looking for a great place in the Midtown Atlanta area. Great location, service, staff, and amenities. Would definitely stay here again when I'm in the area."
"I would avoid this hotel.  It is run down, my room smelled, they didn't clean the room until 5pm and that's only because i called down to the desk.  Its by no means a cheap option.  Look somewhere else IMO"
"Such a lovely space! My husband and I came to visit our daughter. Such a quiet space and very accommodating. 
Morning breakfast was lovely as well. 
This concept with Marriott is my favorite. 
I choose Marriott for all my stays."
"The customer friendly atmosphere permeates this hotel! All services are excellent relative to my experience, and I surely would recommend it to anyone! As the old saying goes,Ã¢ÂÂ Try it and youÃ¢ÂÂll like it!Ã¢ÂÂ"
We missed our connecting flight and had to overnight in Atlanta. This hotel was very convenient and easy to access. We got a good welcome and had a good night sleep.  we had breakfast with decent view of the airfield.
"Next door to Woolfson Eye Institute for convenience.  Enjoyed the breakfast buffet, very large selection of fresh fruits, bagels, english muffins, cereal, bacon, coffee, juice, suites are large and comfortable, very large bathroom."
The Hyatt House Atlanta Downtown was a real find. The Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. They made excellent suggestions for attractions and restaurants. The Hyatt House is convenienty located near many attractions.
"I am not usually one to expect great customer service unless I initiate positive conversation. I must say, on my recent visit to the Westin Bulkhead in Atlanta, to the person I was treated like a frequent and favoured customer. It was very refreshing."
The staff was very friendly they gave advice on things to do and ways to get around town. They were also interested in what we were there for and things we wanted to do. The room was clean and nicely organized.
Very clean hotel with a very good breakfast and a great happy hour. The rooms are very clean. The fitness room was more than adequate. Very nice pool.  The staff was very nice and helpful. Easy access to I85/I285 and ATL airport.
"As soon as we walked into the hotel, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable. Many restauarants are in walking distance, and the Metro station is right across the street. Great place to stay!"
"Stayed here for business.  Great breakfast, nice gym and stable wireless connection.  All what a I need for a business hotel"
"Large room with Jacuzzi style bathtub.  Very comfortable, conveniently located in Northwest Atlanta. Close to Mid-town, Buckhead, shopping and restaurants. Will definitely stay here again on next trip to Atlanta"
"For my birthday, my wife planned a photographic seminar for me in Atlanta.  She chose the Renaissance as the seminar was being held there.  The entire experience, from room to restaurant (Medici) to customer service was extraordinary.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
"Loved it , An the kitchen staff was superb an very delightful, food great here, rooms spacious, I will definitely be returning... Frequently this time with friends and family, staying here was a great vacation for my husband an l"
"Was disappointed, will choose Hampton inn next door next time or several other properties. Parking was horrible, service slow, but front desk was very nice.  Not as nice as expected for the Hyatt brand."
Considering how expensive most hotels in Atlanta are now a days this continues to deliver the best bang for the buck in a convenient and quite location. The business area still needs improvement but no a major flaw in the overall value of the hotel.
"We stayed here for a 16U PG event at LakePoint and it was cost-effective and very nice. Spacious rooms, 3 elevators, very nice guest meeting area and bar / restaurant. I would have liked to see a microwave and small refrigerator in the room."
The hotel is very clean and close to the city. The cost of the room is affordable however meals at the hotel such as breakfast can be pricey. The staff are very welcoming and will assist with any needs.
"The noise level in room from outside is unacceptable. No matter what floor your on. Bring ear plugs if you can't sleep. I thought at first the window was open, but it was not.
good bar and good bed, good location to conference center."
"Checkin was confusing despite multiple phone calls ensuring that our group would be close together and not being followed through with. Once checked in, our stay was perfect and staff was wonderful!! Rooms are spacious and clean, great location and staff is very courteous!!"
"OMG, Melissa is Amazing! I had such a wonderful time in Atlanta! I laughed so much with my sisters.  The hotel was fabulous and Melissa took very good care of us! The room was extremely nice and cozy! Very clean establishment."
Robert and his team of courtesy drivers made my stay a lot easier and took a lot of stress off of getting around the area.  Front desk was great as well.  Comfortable rooms.  Nice downtown location. Free breakfast.
"Good all around room; with plenty to do in walking distance. Avoid the Starbucks downstairs though... its slow, and the individuals running it don't seem to really care about the making thr food or drinks well."
What a  first class hotel. The lobby is a busy Happy place.  The lounge is relaxing with a sweet buzz of conversation. Excellent service; all personnel friendly and helpful; room spacious and clean; view of downtown at night fabulous.
"Had an amazing weekend staying here. Centrally located in downtown Atlanta so it made it easy to walk to most attractions and venues. With the addition of the streetcars that run through Atlanta, it was no problem getting to different places."
"Luckily our room had a great view, but everything else was second rate fom the sheets to the towels to the unclean carpet. Staff was pleasant and obliging, but not well trained. It would seem that management is not on top of their  job."
"1st time to the hotel. Front desk staff are very professional.  Seamless check-in & check-out. Room service was fast, efficient and food was delicious. Housekeeping did a excellent job. Great location. Carmen at the Front Desk ""Rocks"".  Keep up the good work Wyndham ATL"
"Nice rooms but somewhat generic / dated elsewhere.  Terrible food and even worse service in both places to eat, sports bar and ""nicer"" restaurant.  Untrained staff were nice but clueless and, apparently, cooks as well!"
"This was my first time staying in Buckhead.  The location is perfect.  Lots to do within walking distance (including MARTA).  The hotel was very clean, offered a lot of services, and the front desk staff was always incredibly knowledgeable and friendly."
Pictures on the booking site are not of this hotels current state. Common areas dirty and smell terrible. Buyer beware. It seems as though the staff tries but is working with what the management gives them.
This hotels was fully loaded with amenities and centrally located near all the downtown action. I paid $110 for a Saturday night. The ghetto isn't too far away so know where you're going. Uber friendly and lots of local attractions. I'd do it again.
I would not stay at the property again. The renovation was ongoing and extensive. Limited access and no amenities were available. The staff was unwilling to do simple tasks and any minor request was a inconvenience to them.
Wonderful staff good place to stay. We would stay there again next time. Love all the centralized places to visit. All of the staff were wonderful and welcoming. I would recommend this place to visiting families.
Staying at Hyatt Atlanta North was a great experience for me due to that being my first time in Atlanta. I will definitely be booking with you all again for my birthday in November. Can't wait to be back
"Clean, spacious, modern rooms, excellent service, delicious breakfast with fresh ingredients, wonderful staff, well managed reception desk, pets welcome, children welcome, pleasant atmosphere, overall great!"
"The hotel is currently undergoing construction, but it does not interfere with the comfort of your stay. It is conveniently located to many of the locations that I needed to visit while in town for business. There are several amazing restaurants within 5 minutes drive."
"Attended a very nice corporate event today. The room, Faciities and service were very good. The buffet lunch was excellent. Only complaints were dirty dishes left in the lobby, damaged menus outside the bourbon bar, and ridiculously expensive parking."
"The renovations are beautiful to the front lobby & dining room. The menu is also new & I enjoyed the delicious fried green tomato burger, so juicy- however the service seemed chaotic between the staff & it wasn't busy."
Me and my wife will be back soon we enjoy the attraction the dining the evening cocktails the morning breakfast the pool was wonderful it was a clean environment sleep very well and to top it off had a great steak
Had a great experience at the Hyatt. Stayed in the newly renovated International Tower and every feature was top notch. Will likely return for a future family visit and I will stay at the Hyatt. Thank you!
"3 days, over 600 people at our annual conference; breakfast, sit-down lunches, formal dinners, breaks with food, cocktail hours, all executed with quality, variety, grace and good humor. Simply amazing!"
"Great hotel, but I really liked the staff. It was clean simple. One thing to remember shuttle service dies not come or go to the international  side of the airport on my in country. The staff is excellent"
"Great area, clean hotel, nice bar. As far as the service, it was excellent and the room was very confortable and clean. I will recommend it for a nice week end or business trip. The top floor is the top means the club level."
"Very nice hotel. Nice, comfortable beds. Excellent service. Room exceptionally clean-- not a spot of dust, dirt, stray hair...nothing. Most times, I never feel totally at ease in hotels. This stay was different. Very pleased. Would definitely return for business or pleasure."
"No parking, rude staff, told us we had free breakfast only to find out we had to pay after we ate, and was having problems with our key. I wouldn't stay here again the rooms were nice and all but that's it."
This is a great hotel the bed was very comfortable. It is close to the Mercedes Benz stadium and CNN also the Olympic centennial Park all within walking distance.  No free breakfast but waffle House is close by. Also there is parking
"Upon arrival, the Staff was very attentive and the Customer Service really made me feel very welcomed. Would stay at this Location when I returned next time. The Lobby, Room and Grounds were very clean and maintained."
"quiet, small hotel right in Downtown Atlanta. Next to CNN and Phillips center. Comfortable rooms, a little small for my taste, super comfortable bed.  But the front desk staff was great, Latoya was very helpful an very professional"
"Wonderful property -- large rooms that work well for business, nice bar and lobby area.  The service was amazing -- recognized my 100th stay with Starwood with a gratis bottle of wine.  Stay here on a regular basis on work trips to Atlanta"
"Impeccable.  True to the Ritz Carlton name in every way.  Beautiful room, wonderful staff, luxury amenities, and wonderful dining.  (So good in fact, we ate at the AG twice and ordered room service from AG once!)"
We stayed one night in an over sized room so it was very comfortable. Parking is a little awkward and expensive so your room savings diminish unless you self park. Breakfast & dinner offerings were very good in a cozy atmosphere.
Had a great experience staying at this location for a conference.  The customer service was exceptional at every encounter.  They went out of their way to make sure that each guest was acknowledged and needs were met.
You can count on great service and excellent quality when you are away from home.  Bedding is wonderful and very comfortable. It is very nice to have the hot breakfast and the evening complimentary snacks and beverages after a long day.
"One night stay. Everything was very good. 

Large rooms, clean, good linens, all good and as expected. 

The front desk was very helpful. 

I was there for a conference and the food was quite good, especially compared to other hotels."
Had a wonderful time at this hotel and the staff was excellent. From the front desk to every other staff member we encountered. Nice relaxing vibe at the bar and the concierge was knowledgeable and helpful.  And the breakfast was great as well.
"The hotel room was clean and comfortable. The public areas were 'urban', concrete floors and walls, which I didn't particularly like. Service was friendly. It wasn't close to bars, restaurants, airport etc, so location not great."
We're so very sorry to hear that your room experience was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies.
"This was one of my most memorable hotel I've stayed in a while , service was outstanding and that bed had me sleeping like a baby . Very comfy and cozy. Bathers was amazing a tub fit for a king and queen."
"Comfortable clean like an apartment. Very convenient to airport. Great customer service felt safe.  Close to restaurants, bars or fast-food.  Will definitely stay again in the near future.  Free dinner and breakfast"
"My stay at this property was exceptional, I will definitely love to stay here in the future. The Manager Ernst Thomas was very accommodating and made it his business to ensure we were well taken care of."
"Although the hotel is nice, we were not made aware that the parking is in a covered deck.  We were pulling a small trailer and couldn't park it there.  In addition, parking costs $12 which we weren't told."
"This used to be a Staybridge Suites and its the same physical property, just under a new name.  Nice room, good location, great price. I would recommend it for business travel, or the rooms have plenty of space to bring the family."
"We will take your suggestions into consideration, thank you. Your good review is appreciated and we would like to see you again when you get time in our area."
Great place to stay if you have an early flight to the airport.  Quiet and well worth the price for the room. Check in was efficient and staff was helpful.  Evening social event was a bonus if you are there early enough to take advantage.
"The convenience of this hotel to the airport, coupled with the free shuttle is what. Ales this place worth it. A couple perks were the free beer/wine at the afternoon ""happy hour"" and some breakfast munchies for that early ride to the airport. Not bad."
"excellent. enjoyed my stay there. came for a convention,stayed 5 days. enjoyed the breakfast buffet . liked that i could park my car safely in your garage. the bellman was nice to me. i am handicapped and it was easy to get around."
"Nice boutique hotel in a good location for tourists, short walk to Hooters and Hard Rock Cafe and the aquarium and Coca Cola. Rooms were spacious enough, nice beds, bathroom was fine. Staff were very friendly and helpful."
"Stayed here for four days on a holiday alone. Beautiful hotel, with modern rooms, extremely clean!
Not suitable for family stays as the wall between the bathroom and bedroom is glass but would be extremely romantic for couples. Would definitely stay here again!"
"Wonderful stay.  You will absolutely love the location. Clean and beautiful hotel.  Great for groups, families, business, individuals,  church groups ballroom is for small groups only. You will enjoy.   Ask for sales Rep A. Dell!  The best!!!!"
We had six rooms for six of us attending the Textile Trade Show in mid-May.  Hotel handled all rooms above expectations.  The reception staff were excellent.  Very convenient walking distances to the Convention Center and to good restaurants.
Micah Dean is the best!  World class!  I have traveled the world and the lounge is second to none.  Kudos to Victoria and Andrew also!  The food and drinks are first class.  The best place to stay in Atlanta.
"Had a great time the staff was friendly and very helpful.Everyone on staff had a smile on their face. Our room was amazing, loved the whole experience. We had the loft room and was fantastic. the breakfast was a nice touch as well."
"The hotel staff did not bring to my attention,that there was a mall connect to the property with other hotel amenities I could have enjoyed during my stay...I found out everything the day of check. out"
"Got this hotel for a very good price. Room was clean and tastefully appointed. I believe the hotel may be undergoing some renovations. The room was small, especially the shower and toilet area. The pool was nice with a good view and was heated."
"Location, location, location-excellent!
Service with a smile....every time!
Exceeded my expectations of service! Front Desk Hotel Manager 
-over twenty years experience....so believe me...I know hotel!
                                  Darlene M."
Lovely historic hotel directly across the street from Lenox Square Mall.  Convenient and comfortable but a bit outdated as far as technology accommodations in the room.  The hotel is currently undergoing some construction so the bar has been temporarily relocated.
Smaller hotel  with very easy interstate access and great inhouse restaurant..few rooms on each floor...women's only floor...great buffet breakfast ..valet parking only..free wifi and newly renovated rooms and bathrooms..quiet even at exterior rooms facing Peachtree
"I was here on business and it was worth the $75 more than across the street. The decor was nice, the staff friendly and helpful, and the room was comfortable. The sleep was great with only minor noise from the city."
We ALWAYS stay here when going to the FOX THEATRE for shows! We recommend this hotel to anyone staying in ATL. It's location is great and it's clean.  Friendly staff that go beyond to make your stay great!
As a Road Warrior I was blown away with the staff at the hotel and the attention to detail. The entire staff from the valet to the bar staff are friendly and very engaging and I would definitely stay again.
Great staff and very comfortable accommodations - as always.  The room was clean and the bed very comfortable.  Our meeting space was very nice and the meals healthy and plentiful.  Given the opportunity I will stay here again.
"The hotel cleaning staff and the staff during breakfast hours were so positive and genuine. They all asked how we were doing, asked if we needed anything.  Top notch customer service. The room was clean and spacious. The bedding was very comfortable."
"This hotel offered many option on your business trip, more if you have an exposition on the convention center, it is connected directly to your room, they have kindly people to attendee and the bar and restaurant are really good"
"This hotel was everything I hoped for. i was here for a conference and everything about the hotel was phenomenal. The location, the food, the amazing employees and service made for a great experience.I will return again when given the opportunity."
"Clean, comfortable, friendly and helpful staff. I would return. Valet parking at a charge of $24. I didn't expect that, but it's Atlanta. Midtown location. It's worth a walking trip down the halls to see the art."
This hotel was approved for a company rate on this business trip and I was pleasantly surprised with the stay and amnesties that are very close by.  The Atlanta Braves new Suntrust stadium is being constructed less than a mile away also.
"I stayed 3 nights for a conference in Atlanta.   It's newly updated, good overall feel.  Staff is friendly and professional.   Breakfast was good.  Good location and close to all major attractions.   Will stay again."
Enjoyed my weekend at the wyndham Atlanta a most comfortable stay. The breakfast was very tasty. The hospitality was so nice. Front desk clerk was very polite. Enjoyed my stay
Special thanks to Annette Izquierdo for the amazing service she provided my family and I during our stay.  She did everything possible to make certain we enjoyed our stay ....from recommending activities for our children to excellent restaurant recommendations.
The room was more like a apartment . Nice Kitchen with good utensil and nice dish ware. Very friendly staff willing to answer questions. Nice lobby very clean and new looking. Nice complementary breakfast.
"As soon as we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a gentleman named Abel. Throughout our weekend stay Abel ensured we were have a pleasant stay.  We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Atlanta."
"Easy access from the airport via MARTA - 2 block walk to the hotel. Very nice building, comfy rooms. Enjoyed an afternoon on the pool deck (although the drinks are quite expensive). Convenient to shopping and many dining options, too."
New property with clean and comfortable rooms.  Staff is extremely nice and helpful. Just makes things easy and convenient for those of us that are on the road all the time. Offers quick and simple breakfast options and lobby bar is open in the evening.
"Loved everything about my four day stay. Lovely clean room, great comfortable bed, awesome swimming pool, easy to get to Marta transportation, lots of nearby shopping. Wonderful helpful staff. I would come back again."
Michelle should have been here on the day of check-in. My room did not always get serviced. I had to call and request for additional service. The famous chocolate chip cookies whenever warm. The bartender was very attentive
Check-in was very welcoming and friendly. The room was quite big. Hotel location was walking distance to the Convention Centre and pretty much everything. The hotel only served breakfast though which I didn't make use of at all.
"Our family had a great and relaxing stay at Wyndham Galleria Atlanta. The hotel room was very clean, spacious, and comfortable. Our breakfast was served very quickly and our waitress Netsanet was wonderful."
"Room was very spacious, extremely well equipped, all functioned well.  Great indoor pool, dining area, bar area.  Staff was most accommodating, professional and extremely courteous.  Room was great, stay was amazing."
"This is a really old hotel but it was clean. The ammenities are bare. Breakfast is muffins, cereal, breakfast bars, etc. The internet did not work for the first few days I was there but was eventually fixed. The hotel staff is very friendly though!"
"I declare Embassy Suites as my hotel of preference.  The amenities, complimentary breakfast and evening reception are outstanding.  The staff are friendly, courteous and professional.  I enjoy my stay no matter where the location."
"We truly appreciate your comments and are happy to found our location to be a perfect place to stay while in the area.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thanks"
"The hotel and staff were very friendly and accommodating. I experienced no issues during my stay, the room was comfortable and the food in the restaurant was top notch. I would return here. Just be prepared to pay a great deal for parking."
"We had a room smelling like mildew and the AC was poor.  The rest of the trip was nice.  The free drinks are really unknown and cheap.  Like, really cheap so you will buy something instead. That's about it."
"Great hotel. Will definitely stay here the next time we are in Atlanta! Great hotel, clean, friendly, helpful, excellent location and reasonable price. 
First time here and very happy with my choice. The 
Try it you will not regret it."
"Stay here when ever I visit my daughter.  Very good value for the accommodations and a great location.  Staff is also pleasant and helpful.  Rooms are nice size, clean and with comfortable beds, frig and micro.  Many stays and no problems!"
"The hotel was very nice , very clean but surrounded by Interstate highways noise was terrible for a light sleeper. The hotel was very clean very well kept the only big problem I found was the road or traffic noise."
"Clean, spacious 2-room suite overlooking SunTrust stadium. Beautiful lobby and a warm cookie on arrival made check-in a pleasure. Valet parking only...$12/day -- but that's probably cheaper and easier than parking in a stadium lot. Would definitely stay here again."
"The Hyatt Regency Atlanta is an excellent property. All staff were friendly, attentive and professional. I specifically want to point out Terrence who was providing food service to some of the meeting rooms. He is an outstanding individual."
ItÃ¢ÂÂs a good hotel beside you literally have to pay for everything including a microwave lol smh. But the room was clean and the service was welcoming. I will come back when the construction is done. Because it seriously handicapped  the whole hotel experience.
"Great hotel in downtown Atlanta. Clean and comfy and the breakfast is really great.  Not sure if this is a Sunday only thing, but they were making omelets to order! One of the better Hyatt's I've stayed at."
"My room didn't have a refrigerator or microwave, housekeeping was late servicing my room (after 4) on Friday and Saturday, and we had to pay for parking each day.  The breakfast was good Saturday then bad on Sunday."
"The facility is great, and centrally located.  But the staff in various departments publicly blamed each other for mistakes instead of trying to help, with the result that even simple things were difficult to get done."
"For the price, we werenÃ¢ÂÂt wowed. Cable was subpar. Your city is the host of the new Braves Stadium, so the bar should at least show their games. Ditigal key didnÃ¢ÂÂt work. WiFi spotty. Nice shuttle and staff."
"I stayed here for 2 days and boy was it awesome! Nice rooms, comfy beds, great views! The staff was awesome too! Lance helped me out and was the best front desk attendant I've ever encountered! I will be back!"
Stayed with my wife on a weekend trip from New Orleans. Was an excellent t hotel. Service was excellent. Located in midtown perfect location surrounded by a lot to do!!  Well equipped hotel with restaurant and bar!!  Elevators were fast as well.
"The service, the room, the downtown experience was all found at The Ellis. Beginning with the valet parking (don't try it yourself unless you know Atlanta), the service started off on the right foot and stayed through checkout. We'll be back and stay longer!"
"Great hotel, confortable, really nice. I loved the restaurant. Good facilities for any business trip. 
The hotel is also located in a very good spot. I recommend not only for business but for any stay in Atlanta."
The hotel was conveniently located in midtown - the entire staff was friendly and helpful - great visit overall.  Even late at nite was a great tavern (Tmec) and the staff there was great.  All around - safe - clean - friendly.
"Spacious accommodations with resort style decor. Beautiful lobby, delectable breakfast buffet and a plethora of parking. Easy access to the mall via a walkway and an array of restaurants. Suites are roomy enough for families and could allow parents to have privacy."
This was my first staying at twelve centennial  park and I had a great time. During my staying I really appreciate Front desk staff and valet Specially Geta helping us a truly fantastic job. I will definitley be back here with my family.
"The Ellis hotel is a little gem in downtown Atlanta.
Great rooms / Great staff / great restaurant,
The hotel is quiet,walking distance to everything.
The beds are great,the bathroom is full size!
Eat in the hotel one nite,the seafood is spot on!"
Excellent stay. I wish there were vegan items for breakfast. Other than that everything was great. I highly recommend this hotel. It is in a great area with lots of stores and restaurants. I will definitely be back.
Great meeting space with great accommodations.  Everything ran smoothly throughout the conference from elevators/escalators moving people around to food served hot.  Staff were very friendly and accommodating.
"We started out at the Marriott which was disastrous. We left and came to the Westin which saved our weekend! Very accommodating and helpful, and honored our request for a high floor! Will never again not stay here when we are in Atlanta!"
"From making the initial reservations on the phone through checkin and the stay-EXCELLENT
Hats off to Marquis and all other support staff. Thanks you!"
We would be delighted to assist you with your upcoming stay. Please reach out to our Director of Operations at 770-303-3137 in order to prepare for your arrival. Thank you!
"Hotel overall was okay but some nights emergency alarm started at 2pm and it was Very Noisy for a while (and it was every single night and I was there for 5 nights). Now, shuttle service...GREAT! Those guys went beyond to exceed my expectations :)"
"Thought this hotel was great. Room was nice, clean, bed was comfortable and the location was perfect. Close to everything and if you didn't want to walk or drive, the Marta station was close."
"An amazing hotel with knowledgeable and courteous staff.
My stay was faultless other than the pool being a little cold.
The business staff in the lounge were knowledgeable of the area and made some great recommendations for food."
We had a very good experience. The staff at the front desk and in the restaurant are outstanding. They are all extremely helpful and friendly. They cant do enough for you. The rooms were clean and comfortable. I have no complaints
Good place to stay.  Good location.  Valet parking is a mus because there is no other parking available near by. Price was very good for down town Atlanta. The aquarium was within walking distance.  Valet service was also good and fairly fast.
"Business travel to Atlanta - only expected the standard room with just the bedroom and a bathroom.  Surprised that it was a clean full blown suite with a living area, desk, fridge, and bathroom on top of the King bedroom."
"This hotel was first class all the way from check in to check out. The staff was exceptional especially the concierge men.They couldn't have been more accommodating if i were a VIP, which I am not. So so impressed with the hotel and the staff."
"Recently we held a business networking function here and it was fantastic. 
The staff were on point with helping the set up and the ""finger food"" was just incredible.
I would highly recommend this venue for business networking - you won't be disappointed!"
"We met our family in Atlanta for a bowl game.  This hotel was everything we were looking for and more. Free shuttle service, parking, and breakfast. Also, the hotel was close to excellent shopping, and a Marta Station.  We will stay here again."
Great place to stay and extremely clean. Staff was nice thru out my month long stay. Very professional from check in to check out. I would stay at this location again. Thanks for a very comfortable stay.
"This is the 4th year in a row that I've stayed at this hotel for Dragon*Con, Atlanta.  The service has always been unbelievably good!  I've been treated like a VIP each time, and will always come back here.  Thanks!"
"Just spent another beautiful night at my favorite Intercontinental hotel!
Room 2217 on the top floor (22nd), great view and the bed is so comfortable, as always when I visit Atlanta.
Thanksgiving brunch setup was just amazing!
Happy Thanksgiving and see you soon!"
"The team and service at this hotel are consistently excellent.  From the doorman to the front desk, to housekeeping and room service, they have it mastered.  Not only do you get friendly exceptional service, but the room service meals are outstanding."
"Clean rooms, comfortable bed, flat screen tv, nice, big showerhead, free breakfast and dinner. Very quiet, nice and friendly staff. Convenient location to airport and other restaurants, free shuttle.."
At checkout the clerk charged my credit to someone's room. A worker was in our room when we entered to check the air but when I opened the room door she was in our bathroom. I heard the toilet flush! Ã°ÂÂÂ
While the Hotel was nice and all the promise from the telephone confirmation was not exactly as requested.  Breakfast was not included until further discussion twice to resolve.  Why spend more time writing when I have said all that needs to be said.
DidnÃ¢ÂÂt stay here....stored my luggage while site seeing on a business trip.....long story but staff was so accommodating!   I had lunch and a cocktail and staff again were awesome!   I can only assume a great place to work and stay with great people working here!
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a girls weekend and it was really great! The Grand Club guest rooms are very small to be so expensive, so I will not be booking that room again! But overall, I enjoyed my stay."
"No problems, excellent housekeeping staff. Good location, kind of out of the mess of Atlanta. Plus it's right across from Mellow Mushroom, which is an added bonus. Nice room, easy checkin and checkout."
This has a Great location (across the street from Fox Theater). Is very clean with great service. The valet parking is quick and easy. The restaurant and bar was wonderful with a variety of meals ans drinks.
"I enjoyed my stay here! The room was clean, the atmosphere was peaceful and the staff was very professional."
"Good walking distance to local restaurants and neighborhood. Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Room, restaurant and spa were fantastic. Have stayed in multiple hotels in Atlanta, and this is now my favorite. Will be back."
"The stay here was great. I only stayed one night, but I enjoyed myself and the helpful staff. Surrounding areas are great as well... lots of food..... bars.... tourist activities. From check-in to check-out, the process was smooth. The room was in SUPERB condition."
"Great king sized beds with nice pillows and comforter. The staff is super friendly and the concierge is amazing! Walk in tile shower, granite sink top. Mini fridge for drinks. Plenty of plugs for all your devices. On-site restaurant great quality. Day 2 no complaints."
"Extremely relaxing experience with great service.  Spa is amazing with well-trained, personable team.  Service is impeccable.  Rooms are very comfortable with great amenities.  Nice location in Buckhead.  Food was excellent in room service and the hotel bar."
"We enjoyed our stay and we were especially impressed with all the staff, especially Zohra at the front desk. She was customer first focused, extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and upon check-out remembered things we had discussed upon check-in.  Very impressive!  Location is also very convenient."
"Great and friendly staff, Very Clean and well appointed  room, good location, near Suntrust Park, Near many real good restaurants, it is located just off I-75 and I-285. very will landscaped, Breakfast was good and well supplied"
"Very large, conference type hotel in the heart of Atlanta.  Rooms were spacious and comfortable.  Staff was very friendly.   There are a few bars, at least 2 restaurants, and a full service starbucks in the lobby."
"Grace, who works at the front desk, was wonderful. Not only does she have a great smile and presence, she showed exceptional customer service skills. She made my experience wonderful.  The room and overall appearance of the hotel was great!"
This hotel has a great downtown location. Check in was quick and simple. Room was spacious and clean. Bed and pillows were soft and comfy. I appreciate the Aveda bath products they use. Also the free in room coffee was a nice touch.
This was the nastiest hotel!  Don't waste your money.  The furniture was worn and the staff was rude when you asked questions.   The Ruth's Chris was wonderful though.  The good and the service were both amazing. It was the highlight of our stay!
Elizabeth at the front desk was beyond awesome. We really enjoyed our stayand hated to leave. Everyone went out of there way to make us feel welcome. The rooms had an incredible vie of the city. The bed was super comfortable.
"Very nice, spacey, rather quiet. Nice staff. Luggage on escalator :-( as elevators from level 4 entrance were unavailable because of busy hotel workers. Well, we managed  :-)! Here for DragonCon 2018 and we hope to be back :-)"
"We were VERY happy with our choice of this property. The staff couldn't have been more inviting, welcoming, accommodating.  They're just not enough words!"
I always enjoy this property. The staff is always pleasant. Really enjoy the renovations made to bar and new restaurant. The staff is always attentive to my needs. Also the location is perfect if traveling in Atlanta.
"We truly appreciate your comments and are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us while visiting family in the area.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thank You,"
"Great property, perfect location, first rate in every aspect! We like the easy 
in and out aspect. Everyone friendly 
and helpful. Only steps to nearby pharmacy. The breakfast was more than adequate, variety of hot & cold choices,fresh & very delicious!"
"All around positive experience. Easy check-in, good room, quiet. Stayed a few day for a conference and was very happy with everything. Very convenient location in downtown, many good restaurants around. Will definitely stay next time."
"Embassy Suites Atlanta Airport is the best in Georgia. Beautiful place and the service is exceptional. One of the best I have ever stayed at. A beautiful place to stay with top notch service. Food, drink, room are all top notch."
"It wasn't an intended selection.  I was stranded and stayed here overnight.  Nice, clean hotel close to the airport with a free shuttle.  I didn't have time to eat anything so I can't comment on the F&B, but a nice place to spend the night."
"Close to all things Midtown, this is a convenient hotel with quality public spaces, food and beverage and bar. It has a nice vibe overall, though a few minor glitches, was a good value for business travel in Atlanta."
"right in center of buckhead---next to lenox mall. parking reasonable. staff very nice. rooms/bathrooms standard for this type of property. lots and lots of seating in lobby--
very ordinary swimming pool--close to all buckhead offerings--"
"Good location. Staff are super helpful. Did not use the pool, exercise facility or other amenities. Very close to the MARTA station that runs to the airport. Generally the lowest cost better quality hotel in the area."
"I stayed at the hotel for an anniversary / reunion.  The staff was so amazingly friendly, helpful and communicative.  My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer in this wonderful hotel!  Located next to everything!"
"will stay again. this hotel is great, clean, friendly and in a perfect location. love the ruth chris inside the hotel. very convenient. 30 bucks for valet a little much but a great hotel overall. clean rooms and a good happy hour and breakfast."
"Stayed here with family. The beds are quite comfortable and the rooms are quiet.  Staff is very friendly.  Valet parking was quite helpful.
Location is perfect.
Gym was fairly small but they do have an option of using another one locally."
We're so glad we could be of service during your time with us. Please come back and stay with us again!
The bed was extremely uncomfortable and no matter how you laid; you could never find a comfortable spot.  The room was located on the 9th floor on the highway side. The noise coming from the traffic was deafening and never stopped.
"We had a wonderful dinner, the food was good and the service was amazing. There is one person that I want to recognize: Eliana. She was always ready to help us and it made the difference.
Great Job people!!!"
It was a decent visit for four days. Needs a longer shower curtain because the floor got soaked. Need a breakfast that's free because the $6 breakfast was fake. The staff was great but fixed that and I'll return.
Service was great. Rooms were very clean and nice. Breakfast was too expensive for me but dunkin donuts is just around the corner! Great location for business travel. Excel Training was great. Learned lots of new stuff.
"We really appreciate your kind review about our property. It would be a pleasure to welcome you back the next time you travel to Downtown  Atlanta, and thank you again for the kind words!"
"From the moment you pull up you don't feel like you're in Atlanta. Everyone is friendly and helpful. The hotel is amazing! Pure Luxury! We stayed on the 12th floor, very fast elevators. The bar downstairs is great. Cumberland Mall is across the street."
We really enjoyed our stay at Aloft!  The hotel was perfectly situated in downtown Atlanta.  The room was clean and the staff friendly.  The pillows and bed were comfortable.  We will be staying here again soon.
"Your complimentary review of our hotel is much appreciated! Hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to host you again soon."
"Recently stayed here during SEC basketball tournament and thoroughly happy with hotel.  Rooms small but clean, comfortable and well decorated.  Trouble getting breakfast on late Sunday morning but staff accomodated eventually. Great access to MARTA station across street.  Would stay here again."
"We only stayed one night but our front desk assistant was excellent in every way. Very helpful. Lakesha is her name and she set the bar high for the rest of our stay, we were very pleased with the hotel."
Sabra assisted me with excellent service at the front desk. She was extremely efficient and super duper friendly!!!! I enjoyed my stay at the crowne plaza in midtown and I plan on returning next time I'm in ATL.
"great spot to attend a Braves game.  the Battery area had a little something for everyone.  The pool area with the view of Sun Trust Park can't be beat.  Great gym facility as well, over looks the Park and pool."
"Lovely decor. I loved how spacious and clean my room was. Indoor pool was perfect temperature. Enjoyed an omelette cooked to order at complimentary breakfast. The staff was courteous and helpful. Close to airport. Secure parking, $16/night"
The hotel is updated and very nice. The rooms are comfortable and docorated nicely. The staff is AMAZING! They sold me on this place. The customer service is top notch. I will definitely be back when I visit Atlanta.
"May 2016.hotel under total renovation 
Noise level during day and into early evening made our stay very unpleasant 
Had to leave hotel during the day in order to get some rest..if we had known would not have booked"
"Hotel is very good, after the check in, the relaxing time starts.
The Restaurant ""75 Park"" is perfect and the Service is better than excellent.
All People of the waiter knows our names and whis after one day."
"Erin, we're so very sorry to hear that your stay was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies."
"Great service all around at the hotel, but really amazing team supporting the evening social events.  Everyone was so welcoming and friendly.  I genuinely felt at home in the evenings, instead of a solo business traveler.  Will definitely stay here again :)"
"Great Hotel. The Staff were very nice and helpful. Close to most restaurants. The restaurants are basically within walking distance. If driving, the expressway is right there and the Airport is close. The shuttle bus driver was very nice and kind."
"Did a quick weekend getaway for my wife's birthday and stayed at the Glenn. I must recognize Jonathan at the front desk. He was amazing, Class A service. That was a fantastic way to start the evening. Feeling like I'm off to a great evening."
Good property in great location. Walk to Ga Tech and midtown.  I have stayed there a few times during renovation which was fine but now it is all updated.  Bad news is rates are higher. Improved bar and restaurant areas.
"Hotel was well maintained every day and the employees were super friendly, professional and helpful.  The breakfast was great for everyone from children to healthy eating adults.  Room service was great, food was surprisingly good."
"Everything was amazing. Helpful, customer friendly staff. Beautiful atmosphere. I will stay here again and again and again. Valet parking service was great. The breakfast bar was delicious. two thumbs up and a smile"
The hotel was old and needed to be updated. They didn't have my reservation and the room has bugs
"I was very pleased with my staycation at the Omni. The staff and service was excellent from the beginning to the end The check in with Adesia was effortless. The dining was great 
and the spa was a wow factor (request Deon)."
This is a unique place to stay! I read some reviews of a small room but this is a historical building! The room was charming as the building! Workout room great.  The bed was comfortable! Shower only but great spout! I will definitely stay again!
The hotel is centrally located and very clean. Even on a busy weekend the staff was attentive and very friendly. The valet parking was quick and efficient. I would recommend to anyone visiting Atlanta.
"I really enjoyed my stay at The Westin hotel! My favorite part was the Club lounge. Ms.Ronisa was very polite and she met every expectation! I will definitely be back!! The breakfast was delicious, the lounge was so nice and neat!"
"Very friendly staff, the lady at the front desk was very helpful when I had some problems with my luggage! Great location and many things to see and do around the area! The room was very nice and clean!"
Entire reason for choosing hotel location was short trip in shuttle to airport. Coordinated evening before and morning of 45 mins in advance and they told me at departure time. Would not recommend you depend on a shuttle from this hotel
WeÃ¢ÂÂre glad to know our breakfast started your day off right and our shuttle got you where you needed to go! We hope we can impress you even more during your next visit. Thank you!
"Just an overnight stay before flying out early in the morning, room was dated but clean and quiet. Front desk staff were efficient and friendly. Didn't have time for breakfast.
Gated parking lot was appreciated."
Enjoyed the hotel. A little too much noise outside the hotel if you stay on the poolside. Breakfast was good and the staff was really friendly. Really clean rooms and excellent location. We were in walking distance to everything!
"Really enjoyed this hotel. Great location, great staff (kind, helpful, fast check-in, courteous), great amenities, good food, nice bar. Room was fantastic and had everything I needed. Nice bed, good ""office"" area, internet speed was good."

"This was my first  time staying at an Aloft hotel. Wonderful experience. Clean rooms, Polite staff.The breakfast was really good also. I will stay there again and recommend it to others for sure,  Thank you"
"Nice little room.  I'd pick this over the chain hotels.  Comfy chair, nice television, nice view, good coffee maker with real coffee cups. Walkable neighborhood, so I walked to my meeting. I'd visit this one again."
"Went for a 1 night get-a-way.  Amenities were very nice.  But, the property seems a bit older and slightly unkempt.  With such a short visit my experience was not extraordinary.  I intend to visit again."
It is a true 5 star hotel and worth what you pay for. I will definitely come back. Restaurant menu need some changes since it is not accommodating the international guests. everything else was excellent
"The hotel was beautiful.  The room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  Check in was fast and easy.  Pleasant staff.  We checked out using express checkout which was fast and convenient.  The conference rooms and ballroom were all well equipped for a business conference."
Went to see Braves play the Cubs. This hotel was conveniently located close to the ball park. Also appreciated that breakfast was included with the room rate. Also got the Wall Street Journal to read.
I experienced an amazing staff during my stay. Daniel and Dara at the front desk did not hesitate to answer all of my questions and went above and beyond to help me with anything I needed. Thank you guys for being amazing.
"We stayed here during Labor Day Weekend.  Our room was nice and clean.  The bed was comfortable.  The staff was great. The hotel is across the street from The Varsity. Even though the hotel was packed, and the city was extremely busy, we were comfortable."
"I'd recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in the Buckhead area. I do feel the parking cost is excessive, but overall this was a great place to stay and my week there was very accommodating for the most part."
"I stayed there for one night , got upgraded to the top floor , nothing fancy but clean and quiet."
Space is definitely important when traveling with family. Please come back to see us!
Hotel facilities and rooms were very good. Guest room was very quiet and well furnished. Ate dinner is restaurant and was very pleased. Courteous service and overall good value. Would definitely stay here again.
"Stayed here after Phantom of the Opera at the Fox Theatre. Very modern interior with bright colors. Room was bright and warm, with painted wooden furnishings and wood floor. Bathroom was very small and was a detractor."
"The stay was incredible, only very minor issues. Parking gets extensive very quickly...$32/day for valet or you can self park,  but pay each time you leave the lot.  I would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family."
"This place is near the new stadium, easily walking distance. Great price for the rooms given itÃ¢ÂÂs location. A lot of things to do nearby especially when it come to nightlife. The breakfast here is pretty solid as well."
The room service was great and delicious. The staff were really helpful when asked about the city. The layout of the room was on point along with the beds - being one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in
The stay at the hotel was great. I hated losing an hour due to daylight saving time change. I do recommend and plan on coming back to stay again.
"Went here for a wedding, was a great experience. King bed was very comfortable. Also the view was pretty. And parking was free. Only downside was they ran out of cribs for our baby so she had to sleep in the bed with us."
"We actually stayed here well before April 2017, however, the menu did not scroll any further back.  On multiple occasions, I have stayed here and enjoyed it.  The amenities and location made for a great visit to Atlanta."
Mandarin Oriental is hard to beat and the Atlanta hotel is simply splendid in every detail. An oasis worthy of calling home away from home. The staff is the heart and soul of a fine hotel and here service is impeccable.
"We stayed in the double suite for three nights.  The accommodations were outstanding, as was the staff of the hotel.  Breakfast was great with anything that you might like.  I particularly liked the fresh grits!"
"I was lucky enough to stay in this hotel for two weeks while in Atlanta for trial.  The room was amazing, the staff was wonderful, and the hotel was beautiful.  If you can afford it, this is the place to stay in Buckhead."
Our stay at this hotel was fun. Overall we had a nice time. The staff was attentive and accommodating. There were a few issues but they handled them the best they could considering the hotel was sold out.
"Very clean very well maintained, housekeepers were pleasant and helpful evening reception was nice drinks were great and breakfast was amazing homemade omelettes were great the shuttle driver was very nice and pleasant and helpful"
"We are thrilled you enjoyed your short experience and look forward serving you again in the future.
Stay well and remember to live life to discover.
Martin van der Laan I General Manager"
Enjoyed the locale of this property and the flexibility to walk to attractions. Beautiful hotel but definitely needs some room upgrades as it is an older hotel.  Staff extremely friendly and helpful during conference meetings.
Was pleasantly surprised on how big the rooms were it was a very comfortable night stay I would love to stay there again Friendly staff nice hot breakfast wifi was strong alot of nearby stores lite up parking lots felt safe

My family and I really enjoyed our stay here. This was one of the best reunion experiences for us all. The food at the Banquet was the BEST!!!!! We will definitely be back! Thank you guys so much for being friendly and professional!

"Stayed one night for an event and the hotel was perfect. Skip the shuttle driver went beyond the call of duty for my friends and me. Perfect location. Upscale restaurants and shopping centers nearby.  Again, Skip thanks.  Very good bar and restaurant."
25.00/day parking fee even though I was a registered guest. $75.00 fee charged immediately at time of check in for incidentals. Non of the above charges were disclosed at time of booking. Also you have to pay for breakfast.
"We are excited to hear that you truly enjoyed our hotel and team.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thank You,"
"Awesome stay , very clean , brilliant staff ... perfect views over the city . Conveniently located near a lot of restaurants and attractions . Expect to have lots of fun . Perfect for business , travel or pleasure ."

"Park & Fly   Very good Breakfast   Excellent Airport Shuttle   Friendly Staff 
Our late arrival and later check out was no problem.  Shuttle pick up at 1 AM and one week parking while we were gone all no problem."
"This hotel left nothing to be desired. The location, exceptional customer service and cleanliness was refreshing and greatly appreciated. I haven't been to a hotel in a while where I had no complaints. Keep it up Embassy Suites @ Centennial Park!"
"It was an average room. A bed and not much else.  No fridge, microwave, or pool.  The Internet was weak and required daily logon. I had to ask the desk why the restaurant was closed when advertised as open. Lame"
"This hotel is in a great location in downtown Atlanta. Greta views of the city from the upper floors. Fabulous restaurants nearby. The hotel's workout facility, eateries and spaciousness are great. One of the best in the city."
"Great location. Easy walking distance to Fox Theater, Piedmont Park, GA Tech. Great restaurants close by. Parking tricky. Use lot across the street next to post office. Staff very courteous. Breakfast good and plentiful. Easy access to I-75."
"Super Clean.  Very Friendly Staff.  Great view.  Everything I look for in a hotel.  Close to the peachtree metro stop so it is easy to get to from the airport.  Also, a lot of great places to eat around the hotel within walking distance."
"This is my second stay at the Ritz Buckhead.  My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here and had such a fabulous time, came back the next month with girl friends!!!  The Club Lounge is the way to go."
"Stayed here with some friends right before a business trip. Good location . Cute hotel, the rooms were very small but breakfast was great . I would defintly stay here again for the service alone. The people were really nice."
"Room was clean and our floor was quiet. Free parking and free breakfast was a plus.Would recommend to anyone wanting to stay outside of downtown Atlanta. They allow pets, which is nice. Overall a great experience for the money!"
I personally love our location. You are right everything is pretty much a short walk or Uber drive away!
"Omni - CNN is close to everything.  Never need to use car.  Room was clean, however, the hotel is showing age.  Musky odor.  Room service provided quality food and service. Their restaurant, Prime Meridian was great"
The Hotel room itself was way better than the pictures I saw online when looking at the hotel I was very happy with my choice. will definitely rebook this hotel and visit the aquarium my next trip to ATL!
The roof leaks in the lobby and in other rooms that were with us plastic were on the windows due to painting the building outside. Most ice machine did not work in the hotel. The employees were great but upper management sucks
"The front desk staff was extremely courteous and friendly. Jordyn went out of her way to ensure that any issues with keys, towels, restaurant locations etc..  were resolved. The rooms are very nice and always clean.  Overall great experience."
"Everything about this hotel was excellent!  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  The fitness center, pool, restaurant, lobby, and amenities are great.  The desk was helpful in every situation, especially Dorsy!  I was pleasantly surprised that this hotel exceeded my expectations."
"I was in town dia a convention at the Georgia World Congress Center. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a perfect location : walk distance to the convention, to a lot of restaurants as well as to different touristic attraction what made possible to visit those between meeting."
The hotel is well located with a few nice restaurants at short walk distance.  The staff is friendly and the rooms are accomodationg.  This is more of a hotel for business purposes than for family stays.
"Your complimentary review of our hotel is much appreciated! Hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to host you again soon. Thank you."
Wow - what great comments!  Thank you!  We're so glad you enjoyed your time with us and look forward to serving you again soon!
"It was indeed a very pleasant stay : the rooms are very spacious,  have their own kitchen with fridge and oven : service is apt and people are very friendly and hospitalable- even the breakfast and dinner is complimentary : so overall a great experience"
Very friendly people at check in at the front desk and at the lobby bar.   Rooms seem to have been recently upgraded and very comfortable.  I would stay here again and recommend.   Balt parking was a little steep
"Walked in to Hyatt Place after 3 crappy room tries at Embassy down the street. The Hyatt was very clean and very comfortable. This trip wasn't my first stay at either of these two hotels, but it most likely was my last at THAT Embassy."
Excellent atmosphere and intimate. Our family could gather and meet other family members - we were all there for a wedding!  Outdoor space allowed for relaxation without feeling you were in the middle of  a big busy city.
"Robert and Eyan were absolutely the BEST!!! Incredible service, helpful, patient!!! Great attitude and such a pleasure!! They were awesome!! They kept club lounge clean and organized! Wonderful experience!"
The stay here was superb!!!  The venue is great for special events.  The food was high quality and staff is exceptional.  I would highly recommend for a stay and a special event. There is also great shopping in the area.
"Don E. Simon and his staff provided impeccable service. Housekeeping was expedite in services. Sam (Bartender) beautiful personality and kept the glasses full.10's ACROSS THE BOARD!

"We truly appreciate you and your wife spending your special day with us. And I'm glad that Ariana and the team were able to help, in some small way, to help make it even more special."
I have been watching Emmanuel throughout the time I was at the Loews hotel and he is a very hard worker always on point. Emmanuel also helped me get to where I needed to go when I was struggling to find an Uber. Awesome Valet!!!
"We loved the spacious clean room, full refrigerator, comfy beds, & quietness for a good nights rest. Staff were very efficient and friendly throughout our stay. We will definitely recommend and will return again when in the area."
"Michelle was amazing!! Very hospitable and kind. Every time I came down to the lobby, she was quick to offer me a cookie, which were ALWAYS warm and fresh out of the oven. Will definitely be back at this hotel, but this time on vacation."
Other than that the room was clean n the service was great...We would come back again they would just need to have they hot water fixed but me n the kids enjoyed the stay besides the water ordeal.Great value!
"Rita, thx so much for your comments. We're so glad to hear you enjoyed your time with us, We are fortunate to be close to some of Atlanta's best restaurants and shopping. Hope you'll stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead!"
This was my second time staying at Crowne Plaza and I will definitely come back next year. Very nice hotel. I would highly recommend. It has many great restaurants and bars within walking distance and it is right by the airport.
I'm disappointed that you were not pleased with your stay. Please give us a call to speak in more detail about your stay.
I loved my stay here!  I liked the rooms and they were clean.  My favorite part of the property was the spa and fitness center.  It was a full size stand alone gym and well kept.  Would recommend this as a great place to stay.
Friendly staff that went out of their way to help. Even offered help with calling out for food. Comfortable beds made getting up early hard. When in Atlanta I will always stay here. Hot cookies topped are stay even though we arrived late.
"Personalized service was above and beyond the call of duty -- I received housekeeping services after hours, when I only requested fresh towels. Other services were provided quickly and by friendly staff."
"The Double Tree Atlanta-Marietta is a short distance to Sun Trust Park. We took the hotel shuttle to the game, which was a great option. The Staff is friendly and extremely helpful with questions about the area."
"Visit overall was great, additional taxes & parking fees hid the overall cost of the room. Lounge was closed due to holiday (Dec 30 & Dec 31) so we had to leave hotel after traveling 11hours.
Friendly Staff both visits."
"prompt check-in, clean room, wonderful manager's reception, great breakfast options in a fast courteous manner.  Great parking accommodations & shuttle to & from the airport with a very prompt shuttle service."
Friendly staff & clean/comfortable room - that's what we aim for!  Thanks for the great comments.  Come see us again soon!
"The staff at this hotel were so incredibly pleasant and helpful. The room was large, comfortable and inviting. Loved having the cafe/bistro right in the lobby. Delicious breakfast offerings. Had a perfect experience!"
"i have stayed at this hotel 20 times ore more. they have great people and great service. Facilities needs repair, and better internet service but solid hotel for business traveler. if you need high speed internet you need to request a room close to antenna."
"Hotel is a little old but the overall condition is good.  They have complimentary shuttle to all the attractions within downtown.  Even though there are a lot of homeless people there, we did not feel that this was a dangerous place to stay."
"I do not have one complaint.  The staff was great, friendly, accommodating I really couldn't ask for more.I was there for the Great Wide Open Conference and will recommend this center to anyone I know ."
Roaches in room. Even when they moved us to another room it still had roaches. Old furnishings not clean. Very poor customer service all around. The breakfast was not that good and the service was poor.
"Stayed for a ga tech game. Great location, staff friendly.  Free coffee from restaurant. Valet quick and friendly.  Room was nice and updated.  Would stay again , only complaint was the charge to use the computer to print tickets, tacky"
"Queen Zaydah,

You are awesome efficient and I must say one of the best accommodating host I've every encountered. Seriously, thank you for your hospitality. You have made my business trip and birthday one to remember. 

sincerely,

Jamal"
"Very good service and excellent bed. There is little room outside the bed room to spend time in, as there is no drawing room and sofa space in restaurant/bar is limited. Excellent concierge service and top spa"
"From the complimentary parking, excellent customer service staff who happily welcomed me as an honors member, to the room that had such a comfortable bed, to the food and drinks EVERYTHING WAS ON POINT!"
"The JW Marriott has a wonderful staff that is attentive to your every need. Reception, bellman, waitstaff in the restaurant were all fantastic. I had breakfast in the restaurant and it was great. I like the location. My room was very clean and comfortable."
Hotel has great rooms and amenities. Liked having a TV in each room. Front desk staff were courteous and helpful. Great location near the Metro. There are also great nearby restaurants.  Look forward to staying here next time I am in Atlanta.
"Great location to convention center and down town events.  Staff was friendly, professional and happy to assist us.  The rooms  were clean and updated.  Beds were very comfortable.  Would stay here again for business or pleasure."
"Excellent staff to client ratio, the Doormen were outstanding, super friendly and helpful. Nice bar lounge, seemed that where ever you turned, there was a pleasant staff member ensuring our comfort. Lovely landscaping out front."
We are glad you think our hotel is great for family and friends. Your review is appreciated. Thank You!
I wish my survey answers were printed here. Even more I really wish all the issues I had no one else needs to experience and they are ALL addressed!!! I was very disappointed on this stay after being here before!
"Excelent Istalations, services and facillities, the staf it's very nice, and the location is excelent, maybe they need a restaurant but ther is a lot of restarants very neer form the hotel is just 2 block to the Peachtree street"
"- Staff Rude and Extremely Unhelpful
- Lack of Urgency
- Valet Overpriced and Unorganized
- Poorly Appointed
- Hallways full of garbage
- No point in being a SPG member it does nothing for you... Staff will ignore you regardless"
"My experience at Hyatt Regency Atlanta was memorable.  The staff was cordial, accommodating, rooms clean, quiet and great restaurant experience.  Love, love the all-you-can-eat dessert bar.  The location is excellent for sightseeing and shopping."
"Nice business class/ tourist hotel, close to subway and a large mall  within easy walking distance. Spacious rooms with amenities like ironing board, coffee maker, mini bar. 
Complete services offered as in any international chain hotel."
"We truly appreciate your comments and are glad to hear that you enjoyed our team and our fire-side courtyard as well as our hotel.  We look forward to having you stay with us during your next visit to the area.

Thank You,"
"My son's wedding was there.  The event coordinator, Julie, was incredible.  The food was amazing.  The venue was beautiful.  I can't say enough about the entire experience.  My guests commented multiple times about how wonderful the hotel was.  Thanks for a great weekend!!"
"We truly appreciate your comments and look forward to having you stay with us again to enjoy our hotel and staff.

Thanks,"
"The hotel is nice, the rates are reasonable, the room service is iffy, but the food is good.  I have had my share of problems the last couple of stays, but the problems were solved.  The van service to the airport is a nice amenity."
"This was an extremely courteous and service oriented hotel.  The hospitality was incredible from EVERY EMPLOYEE, EVERY DEPARTMENT. 
I definitely recommend this property for excellent service and welcoming atmosphere.  
The hotel was very clean and a pleasant environment."
"Not much to write that stands out here.  Location was okay, reception was standard, room was clean.  Fitness Center was nice.  Probably wouldn't choose to stay here again based on the competition in the area."
"The rooms are unclean, smell stale, poorly lit and the bathrooms are disgusting.   The lobby, business center and dining areas are presentable.  I will never stay at this hotel again and would NEVER recommend anyone to stay at this hotel."
"First time here. Our crew is working at SunTrust Park and Dobbins AirForce base. Ample, well lit parking. Easy in and out. Modern , well appointed rooms. Friendly staff. Very quiet location. Near great restaurants, shopping and services. Glad we found this property."
Came with our family for a little r and r.  Location was perfect. Staff gave us good advice for dinning.  We walked to world of coke and the aquarium is incredible.  Ubered to puppet museum.   Had a great time and would stay again.
"I was in Atlanta for business.  The staff was overly friendly, the rooms were very comfortable, and plenty of good restaurants within walking distance."
"The location is excellent for business travel, close to the freeway and great restaurants in the area. The staff was wonderful, polite and very helpful with the hotel shuttle. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!"
Nice clean hotel. I was traveling on business and it met all of my expectations. Also close to lots of restaurants in the area. Check in and check out was easy. The room was great. Lots of additional amennities for use.
Excellent! It is very beautiful throughout. The staff were all so friendly and Welcoming. The massage was amazing. The spa area was very nice and relaxing. Top notch place. Loved everything about it. We will be going back.
"There are many hotel options in Atlanta Buckhead, however this hotel is low on the list of my recommendations.  This hotel is in serious need of renovation. The room bedding is old and needs updated, the hotels carpets are stained."
Great hotel and view. They only have valet but it is cheaper than most major cities downtown. Being a good member they already had my water waiting in the room! Cute retro theme and as always comfortable room!
The Hotel and the staff at this Embassy Suites are wonderful. Every time I had any questions they quickly answered them. The free shuttle was great to get around and there is so much to do within the range of the free shuttle.
"I love that this is a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired building!  The many wall to ceiling windows in the common areas are just fabulous.  The food here was amazing, as well.  The staff was second to none!  Would love to stay here again!"
"Once again the staff and property were top notch. Even as an airport location, you don't hear airplane traffic. I commuted to Georgia Tech for a 8am class everyday without much trouble, 25 mins on average. Please see my previous review for further details."
A quick family vacation In grand Hyatt buckhead was great! Online checkin saved my time and allowed us early checkin. Step in front was kind and friendly. The access to club laounge was fun and relaxing!
At checkin front desk clerk was not friendly at all. The lady who set up and break down the breakfast area was extremely nasty! I just wont stay here again.
Great customer service. Rooms was clean comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Everything was in walking distance from the hotel. The rooms was clean The staff was helpful and polite. Check in & Checking out was a easy and smooth process.
I appreciated the kindness and helpfulness of the entire staff. I LOVED the crisp and cleanly decorated rooms. Perfect in every way. The ambient lighting was  a real plus - made the room so pleasant and unique.
"Excellent service from all members of staff, very friendly and very helpful. Beautiful hotel and great location downtown, within walking distance of most attractions major conference venues. I will be back."
My room was clean and comfortable.The hotel is located in a good place.Its near Marta and eating places.The staff is friendly and helpful.The food from restaurant is very good.I enjoyed the hot breakfast also.Most say the gift shop had nice items.
"Very nice room, soft expensive towels, best bed I've ever slept in, valet took longer than desired, Sunday church traffic outside of the hotel is intense, great location otherwise, walking distance to restaurants"
"Had a great trip, spent the night at Hotel Indigo, went to the bar and enjoyed and great time being served by Terri.  Her knowledge is great, very friendly, funny and a joy to be around!!  The hotel is very nice, rooms are very comfortable."
"When traveling and staying in a hotel, being able to get a good nights sleep is most important. This is guaranteed at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta. Not only because of its location, but also because the bed is comfortable and the mattress not too soft."
"This location is perfect for concerts at Symphony Hall.
It is within walking distance .
The price is not bad for Midtown and the rooms are always clean.
The service is great, and the staff is very accommodating."
"I stayed here to attend a Braves game.  This is a perfect location to SunTrust park and the mall.  We took an Uber to and from the game and we walked to the Taco Mac after the game. Safe, clean, convenient location."
"I had some of my group stay here for the AACC meeting and the reports were terrible.
No toilet paper, water dripping in rooms, no closet.  I was embarrassed to have my group stay there.  Hair in the shower.
Find another hotel."
Extremely friendly and accommodating staff.  Very nice rooms...  Lovely stay. First class hotel.  Very guest-friendly.  Had never stayed here ... would easily stay here again.  Lived up to what I thought a Four Seasons Hotel should be.  Price very fair.
"Look no further stay here. Wonderful service fantastic food and convenient to all the downtown attractions. The staff is so friendly, wonderful valet service. Breakfast to die for. Dinner and drinks AMAZING!!"
"We are glad to hear that you enjoyed our friendly team as well as our courtyard area for evening drinks.   We look forward to having you stay with us again on your next visit to the area.

Thanks,"
"Embassy Suites is one of my top 2 hotel chains and it's always a pleasure when staying at one of them. This is the first time at this location- it was very nice- staff friendly, comfortable bedding and great location.  Will definitely stay here again."
The hotel is ultramodern and conveniently located. Only problem we had was the room key would never let us into Parking even after having it changed. The staff was super friendly and efficient. Will stay there again
"Great hotel, i was very pleased.  There was a lady who worked in the breakfast area that made it a pleasure to eat there.  The room was in very nice condition, there was ample parking and the restaurants in the area were very good."
"A great place to stay. Exceptional staff, beautiful environment and great food. The bar in the Barrel Room is a fun place to hang-out and meet new people. The bartenders make a good drink and make you feel very welcome."
Hotel going thru massive renovation.  Lot's of construction noise and dust at this time.  Will be ok after - and convenient to new stadium.  All rooms being renovated and upgraded which will give the traditional Embassy a new look and update.
This was an amazing place to stay.The hotel is very unique and lovely on the inside and in a great location. They provide a shuttle service to wherever you need to go which was very helpful. I definitely recommend this hotel!
"Wonderful place to be! This is great place for locals & people visiting! 
It is exceptionally magical during the holiday season that starts in late October! Love that everyone is treated with five star service-always!"
The is a great place to stay!! Delicious full breakfast including made to order omelets!  Very clean and the location is great as you can take shuttle to airport to catch Marta and to several local restaurants.
This hotel has recently been remolded. The staff are friendly. I recommend letting them park the car because self parking can be a beast. Plus the entrance can be hard to find from the road. I recommend it staying here 100%
My husband and I have stayed here several times for events locally. The staff from the valet to desk is always welcoming and professional. Each room weÃ¢ÂÂve stayed in has always more than weÃ¢ÂÂve expected.
"Worse service ever, stayed here for 2 nights and housekeeping never showed up in spite of reminders to the front desk Manager. Asked for fresh towels and took them 30 minutes to send.  This hotel should be de flagged."
In town for a wedding.  The experience at this Hyatt hotel was first class.  Well worth the $.  The valet parking attendants and front desk staff are the most friendly and positive I have ever encountered.
The staff could not be more friendly and professional.  We had booked a suite which was unavailable at check in due to renovations and we were generously accommodated with two rooms instead.  Breakfast was excellent.  Also great location.
"Clean hotel with clean lines and good location.  My room was spotless and spacious.  Check in was smooth and efficient.  Bar staff were polite.  No surprises, although checkout took an unusually long time."
"Stay was great. Left an item in my room and Thomas was able to locate my item. He was then allowed by Manager, Monique, to mail my item to me for no cost. Class act!!  Will stay at hotel again!  Thanks to the staff!"
"Good base for a business trip, room a little small but very comfortable. 
Great staff and amenities. Would love to visit in the summer to get the benefit of the courtyard.
Never quite made it to breakfast but did make the most of the bar."
Please be aware that all cobb county hotels have fees for tourism and transportation even if you don't use them. The cost is an additional $8 to your bill. The rooms are decent but don't have a wedding reception there! Planning is a nightmare!
It was a disappointment.. The front desk never acknowledge my reward status.. To busy talking with coworkers even with customers trying to check in.  DidnÃ¢ÂÂt clean my room and took 3 call to front desk to deliver clean towels!!
"Nice hotel, very close to local attractions such as Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-Cola, Children's Museum and Centennial Park.  Hotel uses mandatory Valet service and there is no self parking unless you find a garage down the street."
"This Marriott is modern and beautifully appointed with excellent and professional staff, fast check in, fitness center and pool, free parking, rooms large, beds so comfortable one does not want to get up, modern bathroom free parking easy access from interstate minutes from downtown"
"If the management were as polite and efficient as the car parking attendants and desk crew, this would be a better experience. You can get a full city of Atlanta experience within walking distance from this location."
"Beds were sooooo comfy and hotel is so close to Peachtree Avenue, aquarium and CocaCola. Great location! Staff was courteous, happy hour was happy. Pool is super small but good for kids. Everything was clean."
"This hotel is a great location - Close to Aquarium, World of Coke, Georgia World Congress Center and Peachtree Plaza, etc.   You can walk everywhere and avoid downtown traffic.  Room was good size, breakfast was nice."
"Great service provided by staff and fabulous location for ATL events.  I've stayed at this property several times over the last 20 years.  Although rooms a very clean, they do need a renovation to modernize older furnishings."
"Chose this hotel because my normal one doesn't accept pets.  First time I stayed at this hotel and will stay here from now on, with or without my dog.  Excellent location, very clean rooms, and the entire staff was very friendly!"
Michelle at the front desk has exceed the customer service ..she has went out of her way to help us with our tire that went flat...she has done everything to keep my grandson calmed and occupied on the computer
"I would recommend this place to anyone when in Atlanta. Everything about staybridge is wonderful the amenities, attractions and all. My family and I give staybridge a thumbs up!!"
"Stayed here with a colleague on business, it seemed like a fairly new building.  Staff was pleasant, rooms were spacious and clean.  Location was by a large mall and a number of options for dining.  Would definitely consider staying again."
"Great place to stay, great staff very friendly place was very clean, cookies were great room was really nice, valet parking went above and beyond, we arrived after midnight and they never missed a beat"
"This hotel rivals higher priced options and will win every time! Modern lobby and rooms, extremely comfortable beds, great staff.  Restaurant is excellent, had breakfast and dinner.  Wide breakfast selection including awesome cheesy grits, and you can't go wrong with the shrimp tacos for dinner!"
"Great value for the money. Good location, staff was courteous, good location was walking distance to restaurants. Rooms where clean and quite. We did not try the food or beverage. I would tecommend this hotel."
"I was at the  attending a 3 day meeting. The room was nice The hotel staff was friendly, including curbside valet staff and front desk team. Great location. I plan to return when I come back. thankkkkk youu"
Accommodations to staff were superb! I highly recommend this Homewood Suites! Our 2 Bedroom suite was perfect for our needs and only 20 minutes from most attractions-even with ATL crazy traffic! You will love it!
"The staff at St. Regis is so incredibly friendly and helpful. They frequently go over the top, above and beyond.  I go to Buckhead annually and my stay at St. Regis is always a very pleasant experience that I look forward to."
"Last year the hotel wasn't up to par. This year when we returned the staff was excellent and friendly , room was clean and housekeeping even left a basket outside of our door to freshen up our supplies due to do not disturb sign."
The hotel was okay just a little inconvenient. No towels at first. Had to call for towels and had to find a TV schedule sheet.
"I've stayed at Amazing hotels before, however this hotel has raised my level of standards. I will going forward compare all hotel experiences to this one!! The stay was worth every penny. I am worth it"
"I want to fix your one complaint!  Thanks so much for the post, I hope we see you back very soon!"
"My family and I have stayed here many, many times. Clean and quiet place, good for a family stay.  I've always felt safe and breakfast is really good.  Management and front desk are polite and friendly.  I will definitely stay here again."
"The Georgian Terrace was clean, beautiful, rooms very dark and quiet for sleeping in, and right across from the Fox Theater. My only complaint would the be the water pressure in the shower; otherwise it was perfect."
"Ricard R. 
Team Hyatt appreciates your generous comments and we hope to see you back soom"
"The room was lovely and comfortable, and the service is commendable.  Although the furnishings reflect its former life as a Ritz-Carleton, everything appeared to be in tip-top shape.  The complementary breakfast is outstanding and about the best I have experienced on a club floor."
"I honestly can not recommend staying at another property more strongly.  We experienced a weekend of staff not caring about issues, loud children/teens running about all hours of the night, over charges, and this hotel seems to allow marijuana smoking in its rooms."
It's an older hotel without a refrigerator but is in a really good location.  Lots of good restaurants nearby.  Breakfast bar is good but we did not know omelets were part of it until the last day.  Cookies are awesome. Kids had fun.
I have stayed here multiple times and enjoy it everytime I come here for work.  You are close to multiple restaurants or can just stay in.  Rooms are all the same size and comfortable.  Staff is always very nice as well
I would recommend this hotel to others.  Location was safe and central to restaurants to eat.  Rooms were great.  Enjoyed my suite and I will be booking leisure travel at this hotel in the near future.  Staff friendly and helpful.
"Took a drive up to the Atlanta with family and two close friends. Hotel was clean, staff nice as usual, stay here every time we come down to visit, because of great service and easy to get to attractions"
"Excellent customer service from every department. Large 
comfortable rooms. Great beds. We didnÃ¢ÂÂt eat there but concierge was great with nearby restaurant suggestions. Valet service was exceptional especially Abebe!"
Our apologies for the inconvenience that you experienced.  I believe our management team has been in touch with you and resolved.  Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if I can be of assistance.
"I stay here often and really like it. But check your bed for comfort before unpacking, some need replacement. Although limited choices, restaurant and bar are quite good. Service is great, location and access are perfect for anything on Powers Ferry."
"Drop your car off at the rental center, get on the skytrain ,get to the hotel and relax. 
This could not be more convenient. 

Very nice hotel, modern decor and very comfortable 

Nice restaurant and bar along with work areas in the lobby"
"This hotel was unlike any other. It was incredibly designed. The service and atmosphere were incredible. Great views from the hotel rooms and such a great staff.
Brian was the hotel manager and he was so sweet and handsome. Can't wait to come back."
The service was fantastic. Great hotel and restaurant. The staff was also tremendous. Asked me daily how things were and what they could do to make the stay better. I would definitely stay here again and would happily recommend it.
"Entirely to many fees at checkout. That weren't associated with our stay. Transportation,  tourism etc. The Hotel customer service staff wasn't friendly. The breakfast was outstanding. Also the Hotel was in a great location."
"All of the staff were extremely curtious and helpful, particularly Jennifer behind the front desk and Kaima in the restaurant. The room was well sized with ample space and the bed was very comfortable"
It's a pretty busy Marriott. Really close to downtown. Staff members were friendly and very nice. It was a very wonderful experience. Love their breakfast!
"We are glad to hear that you had an awesome meeting here at the hotel and had a pleasurable experience during your stay with us.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thanks,"
"Overpriced for quality of room and facilities, ridiculous parking prices, poor service in restaurant, mediocre fitness center. Experienced some rudeness of staff. Multiple examples of restaurant taking a half hour or more to tell people they didn't have the item ordered."
"We are glad that you chose our hotel, the team and I were happy to serve, thanks and please come again"
The hotel  was clean and the staff was accommodating. I will definitely stay at A Loft again. The location was perfect for what I needed. I travel often and will look for this and other SPG hotels for all my travel needs.
"Staff was excellent! The kids loved the kick back time, it was a nice time to unwind after a busy day around Atlanta.  The hotel was clean and everyone was very nice. I love they have t bug e adjoining room option."
This is a nice place to stay for a quick overnight stay.  Rooms are clean and staff friendly.  The restaurant has been out of what we wanted on both occasions we have been there but not a big deal for us.
"The atmosphere from the moment you walk into the hotel doors are very welcoming. I was immediately greeted by a bells man for with check-in direction. Definitely will recommend to my client's, friends and family!!"
Visiting Atlanta for a short getaway. The hotel location was great. We were never more than 20-25 minutes from our planned attractions. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the in house restaurant. I highly recommend this hotel.
"Stuck in over priced room near truck delivery; ear pluggs left on bed! Wow ...
Bed very uncomfortabke and carpet dirty. No mini refrige to place cool items. Sorry wonÃ¢ÂÂt be back to this hotel unless they make changes."
"This property is conveniently located downtown with an attractive lobby and guest rooms.  The best feature of this hotel are the employees.  Everyone was welcoming, friendly, hospitable and ready to accommodate any request.  The property is very nice, but their best asset are their people."
"Thx. so much for your comments, and for being our guest. We're so glad we could be of service during your stay. We hope you'll come back and stay with us again, soon!"
"My experience was awesome I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I will stay there again.  I was there for Bedroom Kandi convention. The location was perfect,  we just walked right across the street for our convention."
The staff was amazing but the rooms were horrible a shower in tub that barely spit air conditioning barely worked. Great location a shame they did not update rooms since 22 years ago the last time I stayed here when it was the nikko
The rooms were clean and well maintained. Very cozy decor. Staff was helpful and friendly! I had a great stayÃ°ÂÂÂ
"Wonderful location in Buckhead.  Everyone, from bell staff, front desk, concierge, housekeeping--was helpful, professional, friendly, and not at all snooty. Unbelievable soaking tubs in the rooms!  24 hr gym, and spa is great as well.  Would definitely come again."
I absolutely love the stay there. The staff there was so professional. And it was so clean in a very convenient spot to be in I was there on a business trip. I'm definitely coming back and did I say CLEAN!!!!
"Very good area, close to mcdonalds and waffle house, very clean inside, staff very helpful.  We loved the decor, the black and white lobby was very nice. Rooms were very nice,Beds were cvomfortable. Elevatotor area very classy. We Will be back again."
"Hotel is clean with great services and amenities, Location within walking distance of all the major sight seeing locations.  Restaurant offers great breakfast buffet.  Hot tub was dirty but pool was in good condition."
"My server was Belene this morning for breakfast. Exceptional service, very knowledgeable about the menu, and treated everyone in her section like 5 star guest. #bestfrenchtoastinatl #belenetopserver #renaissance"
"hotel, perfect.  bartender, worst I have ever seen.  made me a drink with the wrong ingredients, made me a baileys and coffee with cold coffee.  wanted to watch the television more than help customers.  a pathetic excuse for a person in the service industry."
Awesome location outside Braves stadium. We could watch the baseball from our room. Lots of great places to eat and shop all in walking distance. The atmosphere on game day was incredible. I highly recommend this hotel!
This was the second time I've had the pleasure of attending a conference at this beautiful hotel. The employees at this hotel go above and beyond to ensure everything is perfect with your stay. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Food and Beverage are top notch!
"Super close to the airport, free shuttle service, great staff and facility. Parking is open air, so no height or length restrictions. Very nice bar and food. I wish I could have stayed longer than a single night!"
This hotel is run in a true European style deserved of accolades reserved for the finest 5 star accomodations
Made this reservation for my dad and was so nervous but he said he was well taken care of and doesn't want to stay anywhere else when he visits again
"As a former ""road warrior"" I understand how exhausting those types of travel days can be.  It is wonderful that you found comfort at our hotel.  Please stay with us anytime you are in the Atlanta area.

"Typical quality visit. Facility and staff were up to speed as expected. Convenient location, convenient to shopping. Lounge was OK, workout facilities adequate and clean. Free parking was nice. Room was clean and comfortable."
Do not subject your family to this.Dried Urine!  The staff is rude and racist. Bathroom was disgusting with pee in the toilet and floor. They refused to refund my money after seeing the pee.  I had to leave and find another hotel! Just gross!
"In the middle off outdoor shopping mall like district. The hotel staff is very friendly. The rooms are very large with 2 rooms, and ours had full kitchen. Not sure if Marta stop is close by. We self parked which was easy."
A good friend drove 24 hrs from Miami as he was forced to evacuate Hurricane Irma only to have his reservation cancelled by a manager who said he needed to have bodies in rooms and that it was not his problem that he arrived late
We really enjoyed our visit at the Westin Peachtree and will stay here every time I visit Atlanta. The room service as superb and weÃ¢ÂÂve couldnÃ¢ÂÂt have picked a better location! I. CanÃ¢ÂÂt wait to visit again!
Happy with the stay no complaints about the hotel everything was great from the room to the pool and weight room
Contacted the accounting office 5 times and left messages to try to resolve a simple billing issue.  No response whatsoever.  Finally got someone at the front desk who resolved it immediately.  Business travellers have no time for this standard of service
"A very nice/classic Ritz. It's old school with dark wood and classic decorations, but what you would expect from RC. The gym and pool are a nice touch, and it's right across the street from the malls."
"My family had a wonderful dinner in the hotel restaurant. Our server was John who was excellent and very friendly. The manager, Jylyn engaged with us and had a nice conversation. I recommend the bread pudding for dessert, it is to die for."
"This was my first time staying at Drury. I was impressed as soon as we pulled up. It was clean in the parking lot, around the soda machines, all baseboards and every bathtub tile. Everything was clean and the staff was extremely friendly."
"My room was clean and comfortable.  There's a little bar in the lobby where you can get a few drinks and excellent bar food, sandwiches or salad.  We used the airport shuttle which was a little slow but it got us there and back."
Just a quick overnight stay. Room was comfortable and clean. In house food was good. Received good advice on nearby restaurants. The young woman taking lunch orders was a delight. I would stay here again when traveling through Atlanta.
"Soooo nice, super clean room and very gracious front desk people. Loved socializing in the lounges. Nice that after hours they still have food available at food kiosk in lounge area! Very good, friendly bartenders."
You can pay us no greater compliment than saying you would stay with us again given the chance. Thank you so much for that and for your wonderful review comments.
My son left his laptop at the hotel and Derrick was super helpful!  He called us back right away and was able to ship it back to us.  Thanks for the great outcome to what could have been a sad situation!
"As usual, Drury treats you right.  Loved the suite and the front desk lady was excellent with directions in the big city.  So nice and always a smile on her face.  Clean, safe, roomy and wonderful.  We enjoyed our stay very much."
Loved the employee. Room has great view but no furniture on balcony and the furniture is old and outdated. The bed was nice. Air conditioning was not working properly and no exhaust van in bathroom or broken. But great location.
"hank you for your review and post, we're delighted to hear you had such a great experience and look forward to hosting you on your next trip to Atlanta!"
Very clean room. Love the queen beds. Close to everything. Quite location. WiFi was fast. Lots of TV channels. Towels were soft. Plenty of parking space. We stayed here one night. We will stay again. Beds are comfortable.
"This was a great stay, convenient to world congress center for meetings, very courteous personal. Would highly recommend for future stays. The price is a little steep but otherwise excellent. Will definitely try to stay here again."
Great for families. We had a great time. Free breakfast was ok but nice to get something in your system before going out for the day. Fantastic location. Next door was a great restaurant as well. The hotel also had a bar with food options.
Love staying here in a runway view room. Stay amazed at the amount of air traffic. Don't seem you could get any closer to the action. Service is as always excellent. All staff are very friendly and treat you like royalty.
"Really like the service free bottle water after arriving was able to accommodate us with double beds
Room was very clean 
Was able to order a movie had a bar and restaurant onsite
Shuttle bus would take you with in 3 miles"
Just fyi for anyone looking at this hotel breakfast is not included as it states on the website. Also half the room are facing a very loud highway! Kept us up all night. Beds were very uncomfortable as well!
Stayed at this hotel for a business meeting. The conference area is awesome. I love the concept. My room was on the same floor as the conference room so this was very convenient. There are two malls within walking distance.
"My husband and I stay at this hotel whenever we visit Atlanta. We even stayed when they were deep into remodeling because we love the convenience of the location, the friendliness of the staff, and the great breakfast. The new bar area is beautiful."
"We had a bit of trouble finding the hotel as the sign was not lit outside. It's unusual for a Homewood, with separate buildings and outside doors to the rooms - but the room was very comfortable. Would stay here again."
We are excited to hear how much you enjoyed staying with us. Please come again!
"What a surprise!   Odeon, clean and super comfortable! So close to the airport we were able to return the rental car in a about 5 minutes.  The room was exceptionally quite for being that close to the airport. Will definitely stay again!"
My husband and I came for a quick couple stay for our anniversary and it was AWESOME. The rooms were clean and the breakfast and dinner was amazing. My husband and I enjoyed the quietness of the stay.
Thoroughly enjoy my experience.  I actually plan my business travel around the availability at this hotel.  I would recommend this hotel to any business traveler who wants to lesson the burden of leaving her/his home by coming to a quality hotel with outstanding people.
Free drinks every week night. Great location next to college football hall of fame and CNN. Rooms were cozy and breakfast was great. Ruths Chris Steakhouse is in Lobby also next to a Starbucks. Double beds were a bit small but doable.
"Hyatt recued me from another experience horrible hotel experience. It was a wonderful and the staff treated me like family and the accommendation were excellent , and breakfast was just execellent having all the hot breakfast with smile everyday ."
"Only objection is cost of parking at $45. That's too high. Very friendly staff. And staff was quick to resolve any issues I had. I think the rooms were great, location was great as well. Accommodations outstanding"
I have nothing bad to say. Everything was great. The front desk was awesome. House keeping was great. The van driver was nice. Hotel is great location in downtown. Great restaurants in walking distance.
"My fiance and I went to the Glenn hotel for a early evening cocktail and the staff was rude and the service was terrible. It is sad because the view is beautiful but the experience ruined it for us, we wont be returning."
"Great service, very friendly staff and awesome accommodations.  We would highly recommend to our friends, family and neighbors, as the value, quality and service were outstanding.  The cleanliness of the lobby, rooms, breakfast area and general hotel were great and well manicured."
"Room carpets are old and rooms don't look updated at all.  Hard to find plugs, no ironing board in room.  Def not a 5 star place.  Staff is very very friendly, but rooms uncomfortable.  Gym is ok.  Wish I stayed somewhere else"
"A decent but oddly laid out room that was not worth the high price.  I realize it's downtown.  They laughed at me when I asked where the pool was.  It wasn't a bad experience, but I think I'll try somewhere else next time."
"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while on vacation the it was clean looks to have been newly renovated and the rooms was very spacious, however the A/C unit in our room had some small mold spots. The staff was also very friendly."
We have stayed at this Hyatt Place numerous times over the past 5 years. Without fail the customer service has been outstanding. This location is very convenient to shopping and excellent restaurants. The rooms are always clean and the staff is responsive to your needs.
"Thx. so much for your review, and for being our guest. We're so very glad to hear that our team could be of service, and that you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to see you again soon!"
"Excellent hotel in a great location in all ways: service, rooms, food, structure, spa. Had a great dinner in the restaurant. Large room with a king size bed and TV. Large bathroom and couch instead of chairs. Will be back"
The entire staffing group was very friendly and always had a smile on their faces. The breakfast bar was fresh and good. They also have made to order items. I definitely recommend staying at this hotel. Plus its close to alot of things to do.
"excellent experience all around.  Breakfast buffet needed some attention.  What was offered was very good , but more attention should have been paid to the condition and proper replenishment of the food is needed."
Marriott access is easy on the Skytram from the rental car facility. One hop (outside) to the tram into the terminal on the same tram. Kadishia was very professional and fast. Love mobile check in and out. Lemon chicken in the bar lounge was outstanding!
! bedroom suite with malfunctioning A/C as well as a  myriad of other problems including phantom charges cause a very uncomfortable stay. Too bad because this was a favorite but now on to cooler hotels.
Very nice upscale hotel more like an apartment. full kitchen living room with a seperate bedroom. I enjoyed it. Great if you will be staying for an extended period.
"No assistance from the valet service when I arrived nor when I left 4-5 days earlier than expected due to svc. Didn't report to mgmt, nor was I asked to report out on my stay during check out. Clean facility"
"From the moment I checked in I realized that I had made the right choice.  The staff was friendly and concern about my preferences, room was spotless and comfortable, and services are what you expect from Hyatt"
"Hyatt House hotel and guest rooms were very clean, staff members were exceptionally hospitable, and breakfast, which was included, had both hot and cold foods. Omelets are made to order. I would definitely stay here again."
"Call of Duty Major Gaming League brought us to Atlanta, Georgia. Hotel was great. We had a good rate as a result of researching prices. Location was key. Parking and wifi incur additional charges.  Breakfast is not included."
Cozy room with a beautiful bath and shower. Great layout with lot's of space for entertaining. Enjoyed the morning sunrise and city view.
"This is without a doubt, the absolute Best place to stay in Atlanta. Warm friendly staff, great amenities, close to everything. Truly a gem! near The Battery, great restaurants and shopping. You will not be disappointed!"
"The rooms are clean and very comfortable.  The staff is very helpful.  The workout room is terrific - weights, cardio, and machines are all available.  This hotel is convenient as it is pretty close to our corporate headquarters.  It's a great place to stay."
Great Stay! This is a beautiful property that is very well maintained and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I look forward to returning to the Atlanta area and staying at this excellent property. Also has easy access to the metro (MARTA).
I would stay at the Ellis hotel again because the location was perfect. We walked to different restaurants and bars that were close. The bed was very comfortable and the staff at the front desk were attentive and professional.
"Stayed during a weekend trip to Atlanta.  Room was spacious although the bathroom was a little cramped.  More important was how clean the room was.  

Staff was friendly and helpful. 

We enjoyed our stay here."
"Very nice and clean rooms. Quiet atmosphere and peaceful stay.  Enjoyed the breakfast, attendants kept it refreshed.  Only con is room window faced the garage. Otherwise showers were hot bed was comfy and hotel interior was  maintained!  Will stay again"
"The hotel wasn't anything special. I got to my room and found several hairs in the bed. Once I swapped rooms, I got a clean one. It was convenient having my meetings right downstairs and they don't disappoint with the snacks and lunch buffet."
unbelievably helpful staff- front desk and people in the kitchen. It was busy and they went out of their way to be very personable. Great stay! Great central location and convenience as well. I would stay there again.
"It is a very nice downtown hotel, which is very clean and has very friendly staff! The bed was really comfortable and the room 
spacious. We enjoyed our stay. It is within walking distance of a lot of sights and museums."
In Atlanta for a women's conference. Great hotel! Convenient location to the conference. Comfortable beds! Free breakfast. Great service from the front desk. Enjoyed my stay! Would recommend to others.
We had an absolutely amazing anniversary weekend here!  From the moment we arrived we were treated like honored guests and enjoyed every moment of our stay.  The pool is AMAZING!!!  We will definitely be back.
"The service of this hotel was exceptional. The remodel is beautiful and the staff is always helpful. The location was perfect and they treated our group with awesome service.

The new bar area is very nice and serves great food!"
"We had a lovely stay at the Marriott Century Center.  The staff were fantastic, rooms clean, food good at the restaurant and it is well located.   We had confusion with our check out and the management took care if it with kindness.  Thank you!"
"This hotel is a good place to be when needing an extended stay/relocating

Good location Great staff comfortable room. This hotel has a great staff who really get the customer and it differentiates itself from the others around it."
"ItÃ¢ÂÂs wonderful to know you had such a great stay here with us at the Atlanta Marriott Buckhead Hotel & Conference Center and that you enjoyed your accommodations, our Concierge Lounge and our convenient location too.  

Best regards,

"Very Beautiful hotel!! Ran into an issue upon check in but was quickly resolved. There was food near and many shopping malls, I did enjoy my stay at the Grand Hyatt in Buckhead Atlanta! IÃ¢ÂÂd re book!!!"
"I've been working around the country for the past few months. This Marriott is the best hotel I've stayed in. Great staff, great food/drinks, clean comfortable rooms. I would 100% recommend this hotel."
"Would definitely stay again if buckhead was my base. Staff and room quietness was excellent. Coffee bar staff, bell, valet and front desk staff all excellent. Great room views and location steps from Lenox square can't be beat. Walking distance to good restaurants and business."
"I was in Atlanta for the gift show downtown. The hotel is right by Marta which was an easy commute downtown. The rooms are large-- I think they are a bit dated 
Breakfast was good buffet 
The staff was very friendly and helpful"
"Had a last minute layover and was looking for midtown...

This place was great.

Easy check-in. Lovely room. Amazing location. 

The room, while small, was tasteful, super clean and extra comfy. DonÃ¢ÂÂt miss the shower which is everything!"
The air conditioner did not work well so the room was warm and muggy. It seemed as though it would shut off when we left the room and when we were sleeping. Not sure if this was to reduce electric bill
"We are glad to hear that you enjoyed our hotel as well as our location.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thank You,"
This was our second or third visit at Hyatt House.  The staff is friendly and helpful; the rooms are very clean and the breakfast is always delicious.  Hyatt House is always our first choice!  I highly recommend this hotel... good value!
I found my stay to be enjoyable. Room was fine...breakfast good (one grouchy cook out of 7 mornings)...evening reception fun...vary the snacks a bit...same ones for 5 years...room service meals were just warm...left out silverware and salt and pepper
"The welcoming from the staff made my experience very comforting.  I work in the business and know that if those feelings aren't genuine, it shows.  The staff here enjoys their work and represent themselves and the company well."
The hotel staff was very nice. It seemed clean enough but little things like the shower not draining and an older room made it feel average. Not upset we stayed there but will try another hotel next time. Location was awesome!
"Could sweep the floors a little more and also clean bathroom tile floors. I had a good experience with hotel this summer and hope to be back at the hotel soon if everything works out. The staff is very helpful,"
I will stay in this hotel. Love the cookies from the front desk. Easy to access to the subway. Lots of restaurant choices around the hotel. There is the Kroger nearby the hotel too. Not far from the Lenox shopping mall.
Housekeeping staff well managed and professional. Manny thanks and credit to their attention to detail. Front staff professionals and welcoming. Felt valued at all times. Would definitely stay here again!
This property is close to airport. Rooms are large and bed very comfortable . Bell staff very accommodating.  Transport to airport arrived on time and driver was helpful. I would recommend this property without hesitation.
I would have given an excellent review if there would have been shuttle service because of physical limitations walking to destinations was difficult.  Staff were pleasant and helpful. Room clean and quiet.
Rooms need a new look. Very noisy bedroom. Overall look old premises and space allocation is unusual. Breakfast area as no windows and poor lightning. Feel like being in a cage. Elevators are small and smelly...humidity. Bulb not fonctioning for 5th floor
Friendly and clean hotel! Breakfast was always warm and fresh. Staff was always available to answer questions and make sure you are happy with their service. Shuttle bus was wonderful and driver always cheerful!
"Tyler Forsyth and the crew were always on top of things on a very hectic week when many of us went to Atlanta due to hurricane Irma.
Pets were welcome all over the place, the food was great.
Excellent location too."
I love this hotel and stay here whenever I'm in the area.   The staff is great from General manager on down.  The rooms are well appointed and furnished and the location is near any type of restaurant you could ask for.
"The staff was very courteous and helpful.  Very convenient location to the airport.  The shuttle service to the airport was great.  View of runways from our room was nice entertainment, especially when paired with audio from Air Traffic Control via Live ATC.net."
"We truly appreciate your comments and are glad to hear that our team made you feel at home.  We hope to have you stay with us again soon to enjoy our hotel and team.

Thank You,"
"Great location in Atlanta with easy access to most of downtown attractions.  We love the decor, and waterfall near the elevators.  The Chefs out did themselves with the made to order omelets, and overall great staff!"
"Great stay... except for the gross hair we found in the bed and someone else's pony tail holder on the floor.  Other than those few house keeping issues, all was good...The staff was EXTREMELY nice and cordial!"
"Excellent hotel, better than what you see online. Great location for family. My kids had fun. Secure location, worth the price. Staff are nice and client oriented. Breakfast area is large and beautiful, you feel home."
I stayed at the W Midtown during Music Midtown!  It was the perfect location.  The staff was super friendly. My friend & I made friends with the bartenders and actually stayed at the Hotel Bar instead of going out one night.
This was a leasure break and the location was perfect. Good shopping and restaurants in the area.  The Marta is close to the hotel but the hotel provide a free shuttle bus service. Free car park next to the hotel.
"In summarize: It was dirty, unhealthy, smelly, unfriendly, stinky, off-stylish, unsafe, overpriced. 
(Oh, and they stole my jacket, out of the closet, and nobody helped me!)
This is by far the worst hotel I've ever been to."
"Everything about this hotel was horrible.  They are remaining open while under construction and the conditions are not worth their rates.  Buyer beware...they also will not ""make it right"" as they advertise."
"Loved the service of the staff, the hotel's look and feel.  Beautiful staircase that you would expect in Atlanta.  Issues are that the room I was in had noise from air conditioner and the bed was very hard."
The room was ok but found a towel and shower curtain was dirty when I came into the room.  Service was average. Not the worst place I've stayed at but not the best also.
The hotel went above and beyond to make sure my granddaughter had a very special birthday!  Rooms were very clean and nice.  Hotel is beautiful and a good spot for shoppers and people wanting to go to the new Braves Stadium in 2017!
"If you're looking for nice place to stay in Mid Town Atlanta consider this location.
The room was large and comfortable and the staff was great. 
The only draw back was the $30 valet parking.

GREAT STAY!!!"
"I found each and every representative I engaged with to be very customer oriented and friendly. During my stay they were extremely patient, professional, friendly and attentive and I observed  this behavior with other guests as well."
"This is my go-to hotel when traveling on business.  Staff is always delightful and courteous, hotel very clean.  The only downside is every visit there are always groups of kids/teenagers there for traveling ball teams and they run wild."
"The staff was awesome , always so friendly  willing to go above and beyond . Rooms were clean ... I felt like I was in the comforts of my own home I will definitely  recommend the hotel and will visit again."
"If you want to stay in a room with uncontrollable heat, try staying at the Embassy Suites near the Atlanta Airport.  The staff is unresponsive and your sleep will be miserable, unless you love to sweat."
"This location is beautiful inside and out and houses a lively classy lounge and the best restaurant in Atlanta - Atlas. The service here is impeccable and they treat you like royalty. For those hosting clients, they also validate the parking for your guests."
"This hotel is clean and modern with a fantastic location in downtown. Close to the aquarium, Olympic Park, and College Football Hall of Fame. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I would recommend to anyone."
"I stayed for two weeks, Perfect location for business travel, there are more then enough restaurants in the area plus a supermarket.  The room was wonderful, there was nothing to complain about. The staff was very supported."
This hotel is nowhere near Ritz Carlton standard.  It should be changed to a Marriott.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs just beat up.  Room was just plain ordinary and small.  Would not stay here again.  Food is excellent.  Service OK.
"The Hyatt House is a nice hotel.  We had the opportunity to stay in a suite with 2 bedrooms, a kitchen, and living room.  That would perfect for anybody in town for a couple of days.  The staff is very nice as well."
This was a great place to stay.  Very friendly and helpful stay and large rooms.  Free shuttle to MARTA trains.  Free Wi-FI and Ethernet connections.
"We are glad to hear that you enjoyed our hotel and found it to be a great location in Midtown and for going to Symphony hall and Center Stage.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thank you,"
I wanted to treat my wife to a special weekend for our 15th wedding anniversary. She was overwhelmed by our experience and didn't want the weekend to end. Thanks Grand Hyatt for coming through for me!
"this is the nosiest hotel I have every had to attend, the cleaning staff constantly slam door while cleaning room.constantly knock on door saying house keeping, should already know patron  have already check .unprofessional"
"Extremely close to the ATL Airport. Free airport shuttle. Beautiful hotel! Rooms are gorgeous. Front desk staff was great. Nate the Great was very friendly and helpful. Restaurant was nice. The only negative is that parking is expensive. Overall, it was a great experience."
I was very satisfied with the service provided. The room was spacious and the staff was excellent. Its centrally located. Great for seeing the city. Add to that the complimentart hot breakfast and managers reception and its even better
"The staff is pretty friendly and welcoming. The TV in the room is a huge LCD HDTV, which was a surprise. I would not recommend the restaurant downstairs, however."
Friendly staff. A very good value for the Buckhead area. Parking included is a big bonus. Breakfast is good -- they have a decent variety and the skillet options are a nice touch. Recommend higher floor as there can be some noise from the street.
"We booked this Hotel as we have stayed at American Hotels and Double Tree's before but the room we stayed in was very small and dark. Rooms and hotel itself is very clean.  The staff throughout the hotel was awesome, so friendly and helpful."
We really enjoyed the hotel especially the shuttle that took us to and from the Braves baseball game! The hotel was pretty booked and the noise level was loud at times but other than that I would stay here again!
"The Westin is extremely nice & their staff is amazing! However, Michael deserves an enormous amount of recognition! For the few days I stayed there he was extremely helpful & always had a smile on his face. I would defiantly come back!"
"There was a large convention going on. It was EXTREMELY LOUD and right outside of our room. We had to have room moved. Overall, the rest of the stay was average. Convenient location to all sporting events and downtown."
"Great little hotel with great breakfast and exemplary employees. Will definitely stay here again. 
Great little bar in the lobby. 
Staff is super friendly and polite. Free shuttle service within 3 miles"
"The hotel was surprisingly attractive, comfortable, and clean, definitely an upscale experience when we were expecting less. would stay there again without hesitation. Staff were very pleasant and helpful."
This hotel didn't meet the expectations that it should have for the amount we paid to stay. The room was run-down and dirty. The bathroom smelled musty and appeared run-down. We will not be returning to stay again.
We're so very sorry to hear that your stay was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies.
The lobby is beautiful and the staff (specifically Sharita) made our anniversary so special! Can't wait to visit again!  The staff made great recommendations on places to eat and visit downtown. The bed was extremely comfortable!!
"Great price , fantastic room, friendly desk help, will defiantly stay again ,food was really good served early and hot,, great location walking distance of a grocery store, a fantastic mall , you juSt could not ask for a better location"
"The hotel room was lovely, more that I expected.  I could have accommodated 4 people at least, self contained kitchen and two plasma TVs. The food at the hotel restaurant was divine and a lot too. One of the best hotels I have been to."
We had a lovely stay at the hotel.  We attended a wedding and booked our stay through the block of rooms provided.  All of the facilities were beautifully decorated and clean.  The staff were all very polite and helpful!
"VERY friendly staff, quick check in and out, really quick.  Coffee available all day and night....but food to purchase....blech!  Also, the rooms and hotel are spartan, plain, no storage, no drawers....bare bones.  BUT quiet and functional.  Good room not great.  Great staff."
The staff was very friendly and the rooms were great. The location was convenient for the conference we were attending at the convention center. I would recommend this hotel and will use most likely use it again.
people are very kind courteous very well mannered the rooms were tremendously clean I will stay again would recommend you to anyone
The room is very small and the bathroom too. The AC doesn't work!!! The staff was very kind. If will recommend this hotel? No I don't. The breakfast was very expensive to the taste. The hotel is located very well
"Hotel is above average in terms of cleanliness and convenience. However, the shuttle service is disjointed. Driver seemed to be going in circles to pick up guests in the least efficient manner. Will likely choose a different hotel next time."
"Place is reasonable , but bed was old, lumpy and just plain awful.  Room had a strange chemical smell to them.   Breakfast was OK, standard stuff, nothing special.  Outside noise during the night was not bad, but noticeable."
"The room was clean, the staff was very nice.  The room was very comfortable.  Breakfast was tasty.  Some minor maintenance issues with the room, but nothing worth mentioning.  I would recommend this to anyone."
"Beautiful hotel especially their surroundings. Comfortable beds, nice showers. Clean smelling rooms. Enjoyed the melon infused complimentary water. The front desk staff were fantastic, the gentleman all wored extremely well together and always pleasant."
"Was ok as i mentioned my stay was ok but the family with the rude children made my stay not feel so happy , I was thinking the staff should have handle the loud family better and take control of that situation"
"The hotel is located within walking distance of all kinds of sites,  eateries and venues.  The staff is great, and the hotel is beautiful.  Our room was clean and comfortable. An excellent place to stay while in Atlanta."
"Paid extra for a higher room, worth it.  Room service food too high prices.  Don't order delivery from other locations, they can't access room and it's hard to find them in lobby.  Recommend eating nearby, great restaurants."
"Rita, we are very sorry your check in experience was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free tor reach out to us at qualityaltra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies."
"Very comfortable, great layout, modern accommodations! Location was great, wished for a better view but not a great 
issue. The suite was very comfortable will stay again! My family enjoyed our 
stay! Thanks"
Beautiful room with walk-in shower and tub. Frig is not usable-has 30 second to charge mini bar/drinks/snacks. But overall elegant and comfortable room with hotel located within walking distance to numerous eateries.
We're so glad you enjoyed yours stay with us. Please come back and stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead!
I wish I could give less than one star.  Didn't clean the room.  Asked for a discount.  Said because booked thru Expedia there's nothing they could do.  As if booking through Expedia exempts them from cleaning the room.  Ridiculous
We were on an extended baseball trip. Expected a refrigerator in the rooms but didnÃ¢ÂÂt have one. Was told we could have upgraded but didnÃ¢ÂÂt know we needed to. Rooms need an update and the double beds are not very comfortable.
"Beautiful, elegant and very clean hotel.  Large standard room had a comfy king bed and wonderful bathroom.  I loved The Nook (free coke products and snacks)!  Quiet despite construction across the street"
I love the room and bathroom ! Very spacious and comfortable !  With quick elevators ! Amenities provided were great as well and it is equipped with a full living room and an extra mirror and sink which came in handy !
"Every level of staff was attentive and very helpful.  Super pleasant and very responsive.  the rooms are clean and the Bistro staff is great, whatever you need.  Close to the best mall in town - Lennox Square."
"Comfortable, spacious, complete. Excellent hotel and experience in Atlanta. We celebrated our 36th wedding anniversary here and it was a good experience. Everyone was nice and professional. Best Hotel in 5 years."
Reserved king bed back in January for late arrival.  When I checked in at midnight on July 17 they had no king beds left and they gave me 2 queens instead with no type of apology.  We will never stay here again.
"If your interested in a great stay with a clean room great service, a restaurant that knocks it out of the park with a great location close to a lot of interesting places for families,  then I strongly suggest this location"
It was wonderful having you stay with us and we're pleased to hear you enjoyed every second of your stay. Our team is always readily available to ensure your experience is perfect from check-in to check-out.
"Beautiful Upscale hotel. Plenty of quiet nooks to do work, chat or decompress: fireplace, terrace, zen garden, grotto. Zen garden is lovely! Gym great. Staff truly exceptional. I made an error in my reservation and they helped me find a place to stay."
"We love the location and service at The Ritz! Perfectly situated to walk anywhere for eating, shopping or touring Atlanta. We stayed for a concert and the rooms are very nice with outstanding service on the club level!"
"I agree with you, not many people use the tub's anymore.  I will be sure to bring this up when our rooms are renovated again. Thank you!"
"Everyone at the hotel was very nice, starting with the manager who checked us in.  The view from our room on the 67th floor was spectacular.  Make sure to go up to the observation deck on the 72nd floor to see the sights."
If you are looking for an above average hotel at a great price with a good location this is it.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Bar was fun.  Very clean and many things within walking distance.  SHuttle was very accomodating
"Decent accommodations based on comparison of area. Construction woke us too early each morning. Hot breakfast was a disappointment, lack of quality hot items on the menu. Room was clean and fresh. Staff was great, just not enough of them. Overall ok stay."
We came by Atlanta for shopping and stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead and it was fabulous. The location was phenomenal with walking distance to the malls and dining. It was overall an amazing experience.
Overall stay was nice. The pool was not in service for our stay. They have a shower instead of a bathtub. Shaving was difficult with nothing to prop leg on. Door to shower was next to toilet which made it awkward to maneuver around.
"All good - was only in the property for 9.5 hrs. but all was good - would have preferred restaurant and bar to be open past 9:30 - but there were other places close to eat. See you next time in town, Sincerely Joe Pesce"
"Excellent place , shopping, eating, playing, walking, partying.    Great for sports fans who love baseball.  And the Atlanta braves.  Park the car and never have to get in it again until you go home. God a love it !!!!!!"
Me and my friends had a staycation and chose the Westin Buckhead as our hotel.  The staff was very friendly and extremely accommodating.  The staff in the club room Eyon and Alyssa made sure that all of our needs were met.
"Had upgrade to apartment.  It was a very cold weekend and it was fabulous to stay there.  Great location, easy to get around, the room was decorated in a very warm style with gray colors.  Food was great, staff was friendly."
Staff was very professional and personable.  Check in was fast and I was recognized as a gold passport member. The rooms at Hyatt Place are very roomy and clean. Location was in Buckhead with free parking.  I would definitely recommend staying here.
"Watch out, they will not let you cancel a reservation unless you are hospitalized. Employees are rude."
"We are very pleased you enjoyed your stay with us.  We are happy to be of service and we hope to see you again.  Until then... safe travels!

Warmest Regards,"
Simply horrible experience would not recommend to anyone. The front desk and checkin experience was terrible. Our reservation not honored and she lied. The restraint experience was poor refusing to accept breakfast coupon when the food was not available at buffet
We have stayed at this hotel several times.  This was the worst.  The staff was rude and had no concern for our satisfaction of anything we brought to their attention.  No plans to ever stay at this hotel again.
Great Stay for value & location! Rooms are comfortable and clean.  Decent fitness center.  Probably the best value for location.  I particularly enjoyed the cleanliness of room.  I'd like to see them upgrade a bit to keep the edge!!!
Thx. so much for your review. We're so glad our team could be of service during your convention. Thx. so much for being our guest. Please come back and stay with us again!
Business trip to Atlanta. The staff was warm and always greeted me at the door as I walked in and out. Breakfast was on time each and every day. The staff throughout the hotel were polite and made it a wonderful experience!
"Arrived and provided room upon arrival, no wait.  Internet Checkin.  Great central location for doing business.  Staff was friendly.  The room was perfectly lit for doing work and getting a great night sleep.  Quiet room too."
Great room; great breakfast and awesome front desk service. We will stay here on our next trip to Atlanta. The rooms were clean and the area is a very nice place to stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Atlanta
"Wonderful hotel. Very convenient location to Mercedes Benz Stadium, Olympic park, world of Coca Cola museum, CNN tour all in walking distance. Very comfortable beds excellent showers and extremely nice front desk And valet parking."
"This place is amazing and how people can treat u like ur at ur home, whole staff house-keeping, front desk, managment is even around when we checked in (Ervin Marshall) looking after his staff and if everything is done corecttly thank u all."
"We are local to Atlanta, but always stay at the Hyatt for conventions. The check in process was simple, staff was friendly and the room was quiet and comfortable. The only complaint were the 5.00 bottles of water in the mini fridge."
"Service  is great. Beds are super comfy. Internet needs to be stronger, the farther you are from the elevator the worse it is."
"The pool is was great and all the staff was great, very helpful, the breakfast was fabulous, The location wasnÃ¢ÂÂt themat far for the attractions and night life I would book the
 Anytime. Prices was great for a great vacation."
Stopped while returning from Disney with two grandkids.  Everything was nice and the supper and breakfast included was very good.  We always stay at one of the Drury's in the Atlanta area when traveling
I do not recommend this hotel.  Extra money was taken from our account for incidentals.  This was not explained upon check-in.  It takes too long for it to be refunded.  Valet is understaffed..difficult for the staff and guests.
Terrible staff all around except valet and van drivers Place needs to be re-staffedf with people who care.No control of the property Would never stay here again while visiting Atlanta and rather stay in a motel six
"One of the nicest hotels IÃ¢ÂÂve visited. Brand new, spectacular views of the field. Even the views facing the city are nice. Most importantly, the staff here are super attentive, friendly and accommodating."
Great hotel in great location and rooms that offer comfort and everything we expected. The location is good and breakfast is nice. Staff were all great from check in to check out and in between. I recommend the hotel.
"Shower accommodating, and great location. Within walking distance to most Atlanta downtown attractions (1-2 blocks). Staff was friendly and the pool and gym area are better than most others. Will definitely stay here again."
"The hotel was nice and reasonably priced. The breakfast was good! Our waitress, Netsanet, was very kind and hopefully. The room was also quite spacious and tidy! I would definitely come back whenever I visit this area again!"
"From the time of check-in until we checked out, We experienced great customer service, a warm and inviting atmosphere, and exceptional cleanliness, all of which made our stay awesome!  Their shuttle service was great and accommodating, and The restaurant was a plus too!"
"The hotel is in walking distance to Marta, Piedmont Park and many restaurants. We liked the restaurant, Zocalo which was only a few blocks away. Hotel was clean, beds were comfortable. Staff was helpful and attentive. I will definitely stay here again."
"Friendly staff, great room and location.  Stayed one night to attend concert at Chastain Park.  Free limo ride.   Great breakfast. Cookies at check-in. Would breakfast here again."
"lazy front desk, management not interested even write answer on complain. 
If you want to go to lounge, it is closed over weekend 
breakfest inclueded in price means that they will send you to fast food !!!"
"desk staff are wonderful  hotel should not be a Wyndam  asked for GM, was told he quit like the previous...................breakfast staff needs friendly service training needs cleaning and renovation   taxi cab drivers fighting over fares is a joke"
Above expectations. They are trying hard to make a good impression and succeeding. Workout facilities were by far the best I've encountered at any hotel. Nice bar area next to nice restaurant.  We will be returning
We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us! Thx. so much for your review. Please come back and stay with us again!
"The service in the hotel restaurant was excellent!  Top notch.  Each employee was helpful, friendly, and pleasant.  The food was great, fairly priced, and plentiful.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.

JK"
"Second time at this hotel.  First time there was no issue.  This time I could not regulate the temperature in my room.  They sent a technician each time I called, however, issue never fully resolved. Other than that, hotel was great."
The staff and the amenities at this location was breathtaking. The staff catered to my every need and the facilities were beyond my expectation. Sterling in the dining room was very attentive to our needs.
"With your compliments about our restaurant (Cook Hall), our Living Room bar and our WET Deck pool we are so excited you had such a wonderful time!  We can't wait to see you again soon!"
"Wonderful place to stay! Friendly and very helpful staff! Walking distance to the Georgia Aquarium and lots of fun eating establishments! If you're going to be in Atlanta, this is the place to stay!!!!!!!"
The bedroom was smaller than the living room (tight). Our dishwasher wasnÃ¢ÂÂt properly installed. The breakfast was mediocre. Service was good and the area was nice and quiet. It was an alright place to stay.
"Hotel has a great location near businesses, shopping and food. Can walk to most. Staff was very friendly and informative. Bar in hotel offers small plates and had a great patio area. Loved the breakfast.Room was well done and clean."
"Trip for ATL United soccer games 4th of July weekend was great location, good value and close to dining and activities including College Football Hall of Fame. Valet parking was easy and convenient. Would recommend for location."
"Two large Conferences at one time? Not a problem! Great stay and conference this week. From check-in to meeting breaks, the staff was amazing....easy to move around hotel, service, food, and rooms were super...thank you!"
"Heating / AC  Room Temperature was superior.   None of the freezing, heat or cold spells you get in many places where the temp fluctuates."
"Great place to stay, nice bar, good food for a fair price, good parking lot security, friendly staff and great overall experience. I will definitely be back again, way better experience from the last place I stayed in atlanta."
We're so very sorry to hear that your room and stay have not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityatlgh@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies.
If you want to reserve multiple room with non working air conditioning then this is your place! We reserved two rooms arrived at 10pm. Front desk could not program the keys and thought a free bottle of water was a big deal.
We had a great experience for our party and the staff are wonderful.  The food was excellent and the room was just beautiful.  The party planner was great and did everything to make this party a success.
"This place exceeded my expectations.  The room and bathroom were spotless.  The bed was amazing, as were the pillows.  The pool was always clean, the staff was friendly, and the only complaint I have is that we couldn't stay longer. Lol."
"Lovely hotel.  Great location.  Room was very comfortable. Bathroom was very nice with a great shower head.  Lots of outlets and a nice desk for working.  

I was attending a conference and the catered food was very good."
"We would return to this hotel any time.  Rooms were clean, neat and quiet.  Evening reception was a nice touch.  The location is really perfect.  Nice area close to convention center. No complaints about the service.  Friendly staff."
"Very welcoming staff, clean and spacious rooms, very comfortable bed, and good breakfast.  Efficient check in and check out with a smile.  Staff seems like they really care about taking care of their guests."
"The Doubletree at Atlanta Airport is very convenient and comfortable to stay when I am on business or pleasure.  The staff very helpful.  No Ezecutive Room or free drink vouchers for Diamond Members, which I feel this would enhance oneÃ¢ÂÂs stay if one travels alot"
"Great location for hotel, right in the heart of everything. Everything is within walking distance which is a great thing when you don't have transportation. Restaurants and all are within walking distance along with the Aquarium and the College Football hall of fame."
We had a great 4th of July weekend at the Marriott in Atlanta.  We came up for a 3 night trip to see family.  It is the picture hotel if you are traveling with children. I love the location. I would go back!
"A step back in time with all the modern amenities and touches. Great staff, food and location. Even though undergoing a major outdoor construction project, from within there were no disruptions or unwanted noise."
Stayed just one night on a Business Trip. Great location. Older Hotel but the renovations are excellent. I had the dbl bed accommodation - bed wasn't super comfy but i'm nit picking. Overall this hotel is very good. I'd definitely stay there again.
Ideal for quick overnight stay in the Atlanta Buckhead area. Great value and convenient to Lennox mall and all the Buckhead nightlife and entertainment spots. Great value for points from Hyatt gold passport membership.
I have been staying here a few months and the staff is great.   All rooms have a kitchen which are very nice.   Bathrooms need to be remolded but I was informed that is being done.   Pizza bar is delicious.
This hotel is absolutely stunning!! All the updated amenities made you feel right at home. I will highly recommend this property in the Atlanta area. I'm definitely looking forward to staying here again.
I love being part of the HHonors they treat you very good. I slept like a baby. Love the Jacuzzi tub. Breakfast was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly. Love the location we were in. Can't wait to come back.
Stayed here for a National Convention .Long Walk to rails. The rooms are nice and clean.. Free taxi ride a must.. will stay again.. Friendly staff. Make sure a tip the driver and maids...Not pet friendly.
"Although the Hotel itself is beautiful and of architectural note, the maintaining of the building leaves much to be desired. The hallways were filthy and untidy, more than just room service trays left."
We stayed at this hotel because we had an early flight. The employees were super nice and did what they could do to make our stay Pleasant. The rooms were great but the bathroom however was a little small. I would recommend staying here.
"Trent, we're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us for your show at the Fox. It's a real Atlanta treasure! So glad we could be of service. Come back again for the next show!"
"Unfortunately, the iconic atmosphere at this hotel is no more.  It is to be rebranded which means downgraded.  The clubby atmosphere of the bar lounge with classic wood paneling and fireplace is gone.  Things change with the times but this change is not welcome."
We are very sorry that the guest feels that this incident  was not handled correctly.  We have received statements about the incident as well have reviewed video and feel that we have acted appropriately
"I would highly recommend this hotel.  The staff was friendly & accommodating.  Breakfast included.  Rooms very clean. The location is in the heart of downtown with a restaurant next door.
And they also serve meals"
Loved staying at this hotel. So close to the airport! Very nice staff. Great value for a Westin. Not a lot around the hotel but not far. And ohhhhh those Heavenly Beds!!!!  I would definitely stay here again!
Each step of the way the staff is there to assist your every need. My favorite place is having the club as a base for my morning coffee and afternoon and evening drinks.  The new coffee maker is the best
"As an SPG Platinum, I always feel like I get treated like a king at this beautiful property! The custom service never ceases to amaze; and while I didn't get upgraded I felt like I did by the level of service"
"I was here for a wedding , the service was great!! This hotel made my friend special day amazing!!!! Everything was first class!!!!!  Her wedding suite was everything someone could ask for!! The butler was super helpful and the staff remained very professional!!"
"Overall, the hotel is great! The staff is also great, especially Darrel (hope the name is correct), he was very courteous and professional. We also noted he treated everyone the same, from the guests to his co-workers. Very nice to see."
very nice and well maintained. The staff were friendly. Hotel is off of the highway. I find that having friendly staff also requires friendly people who choose to stay there. if you want quality service then kindness to others goes both ways.
Parking was terrible.  Ended up taking uber or just walking instead of losing parking space.  Shower leaked.   Front desk staff was not as friendly.  Family members had to wait for hours to check in after 4.
"I enjoyed my stay so much that I am planning another trip to the area for my family. The peaceful environment and indoor pool will be enjoyed by everyone. The shopping, performing arts, and other activities in the area will also make the trip memorable."
Michelle was very accommodating and sweet. She was the only one working on both days and she was smiling the whole way through. She was the only welcoming soul at the hotel and she made all of us smile
"This hotel recently had a $16M renovation, and it SHOWS! Excellent atmosphere, warm/cozy places to hang out, and terrific food. Chef Jeff is a creative genius. If nothing else, go for a meal. I recommend the Miso Salmon and anything chocolate that Chef creates."
The hotel has been recently refurbished with a very new and modern update. The complimentary reception is fantastic and all the staff were super friendly and helpful. You just can't beat the value for the price paid.
Hotel was in a great location but the staff definitely needs training customer service.  Items went missing and I was treated like the criminal.  Hopefully they will train there staff to more customer service oriented.
"Hotel staff very friendly, courteous and extremely helpful...Great comfortable rooms bed was very comfortable bathroom was large and clean.... I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay at this hotel again.."
"We had an amazing time at Aloft, perfect location for travelers. Very helpful staff.   Very clean environment. Kid and Pet Friendly, extremely nice staff. I will recommend for any type of  traveling rather its is business related or family vacation."
"We enjoyed drinks and food here on both Friday and Saturday night.  They offered great bar food choices and very good bar service.  There was lots of room for our very large celebrating group.  Service was very good too!  It was a fun, enjoyable place."
Location is best thing this hotel has going for them. Seems to be falling on cleaning skills. Hopefully they will step it up! Elevators are slow but with tons of people thatÃ¢ÂÂs what u get. Overall best location
"Hotel was close to work and the center of Atlanta. Only issue was no pool and tight parking. Hyatt Regency is less tan a block away but you can't use their pool, which is odd. Hotel was clean and neat."
"coffee not available and is normally cold, book this hotel on promise of evening meal must think again next time. This hotel not doing Home - wood suites group any favours
Computer does not work, very poor"
Have been traveling to Atlanta on an almost monthly basis for the last several months and stayed in various hotels along the way. The Loews team is absolutely top notch when it comes to all around excellent service. Looking forward to future visits!
"Poor bedding quality...tough to get good rest, mediocre breakfast at best, very poor bar selection items. Staff polite but too casual, they congregate and multiple people listen in to the interaction at the front desk."
Hotel is new but our bathroom shower had mold in ceiling and all over glass and tile.  Disgusting for a $200 night stay and it's over a two mile walk to SunTrust Park.  Manager only took $50 off bill for moldy bathroom.  Pitiful customer service.
Aweful experience! Does not treat their Diamond members are not treated well at all. Breakfast buffet items were cold. Staff members not helpful. Had to call several times to front desk and had to ask to move roons.
"What a beautiful hotel.  So luxurious.  This may be one of the best night's sleep I've ever had.  I understand the SPA is wonderful to.  I can't wait to come back.  This is very close to Chastain park.  Just an uber drive aways,"
"Stay for a week wanted stay longer because  of the service  everyone provided. I wanted thank Mary,Rosemary,Andrew and the young lady that works the bar at night. Next I'm in Atlanta  I will be returning  because  of your service  thank you."
"My apologies about your parking issues, Please contact me at the hotel to discuss further."
We went to an Atlanta Braves game. We were able to walk to the stadium from the hotel. The hotel is extremely nice. Rooms were vary clean and spacious. The staff was very good. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
"The staff were very welcoming and professional

The hotel is ideally located, the rooms huge with all the facilities required

The service was faultless and the costs very reasonable

A little airport noise but this was to be expected"
"Always enjoy our stay in Buckhead.  Excellent service every time we are there.  The staff is always helpful whether it be upstairs, the business area or when it comes to foood service Big shoutout to Eric and Anthony at the front door."
"One of the very best hotels. Love to stay here. Always treated very well. Starts with a greeting from the valet, through check in and getting settled in the room. Very friendly, caring, and efficient!"
Very nice hotel. Friendly stuff and nice located. It is always a pleasure to come back and spend some nights at Villa Christina. Rooms are quite and clean; very spacious. I personally would highly recommend this!
"Very nice hotel, great location and service from the staff. Close to transportation and places to eat. The only negative is that you could hear the cars driving through parking garage across the street."
"We stayed here for 3 nights for a conference and enjoyed the breakfasts, free USA Today, and even the exercise room. The coffee was available all day, and the afternoon cookies added to the experience."
"Surprised that a hotel like this did not have a mini frig or microwave in the room. Also, last two nights of a week long stay was noisy - slamming doors, people in the hall, and children being loud late at night."
I couldn't have said it better myself!  We look forward to welcoming you back to W Buckhead!
Great place to stay friendly staff and perfect around everything. Pet friendly have a big place for them to run around. Kitchen fully equipped with Basic stuff. I have no complaints at all about this place
"Was unaware of the $30 per day parking fee. Very clean hotel in a convenient location in midtown. 
Breakfast is expensive at $13.50, should be less if not complimentary .
My room faced interstate and couldnÃ¢ÂÂt darken the windows"
"Great location and hotel property.  Should not have to ask several times for things like a roll away bed and rooms near each other.  Love the rooms, beds and house keeping service.   Great Sunday Brunch with jazz."
"Stayed here for a conference. Very good service, great room, excellent bar. Beds are great. Water pressure was an issue once and WiFi costs extra. Self parking was $28 per day. The bar in the lobby made the best whiskey sour IÃ¢ÂÂve had."
"A very nice stay and I really like the attention that the staff gives you! I can't stand lazy staff, so this was right up my alley- and what I'm used to. Perfect location for out of town visitors who want a taste of Buckhead."
"The staff at this hotel is one of the best. They took special care of all my special requests. The shuttle even took me to grab some items at the local pharmacy. Very close to office, great restaurants and shopping!"
This hotel was a great find in midtown. It is perfect walking distance to many great restaurants.  The staff was friendly and the rooms were very clean and spacious.  We got a great deal on Orbitz for $140 a night!
"Great conference facilities, food, and staff.  Very clean, up to date.  Rooms are first class. Great gym, market, beautiful lobby, friendly door and desk staff.  Easy to get to from Marta station.  Close to GT campus.  Will be back."
"The locations of this hotel, for tourism, could not be better. Steps away from AtlantaÃ¢ÂÂs Aquarium and The Coca Cola World. Also walking distance from the main downtown tourist attractions. 
Rooms are clean and spacious but do need an urgent refresh."
"The rooms are relatively small, but the hotel is very smart and comfortable, for the price.  Great location. Right across from the Fox Theatre and within walking distance of many restaurants and bars.  A very trendy scene."
The staff were exceptional in their attitude and attention to my needs. The conference facilities were excellent and the gym one f the best I have used in a hotel. Best hotel I have stayed in the USA.
"Excellent/enjoyable stay at Hyatt Place Buckhead. Definitely will recommend this hotel to my friends/relatives. Services such as cleanliness, customer relations, wifi, parking Are all very satisfactory. Staff are very welcoming and friendly From room attendants to shuttle drivers. Thank you."
"Lobby and reception are nice.  But the room was dirty.  The phone was broken and the service was poor.  
There are so many better places to stay.  I stayed as a Gold elite member but got no recognition nor any benefits."
"The fact that Aloft takes dogs with no up charge is great. Since in Atlanta you need to drive everywhere anyway, this hotel is well located to visit Atlanta, you can walk the dog in Olympic Park 2 blocks away. Hotel is clean and quiet."
We literally requested extra towels the entire weekend! We finally had to track down a housekeeper to get our own towels. Housekeeping didn't clean our room or remove trash the entire eeekend! There were 3 towels in a room that was reserved for 4 people.
"Love this hotel. We come here every year for karate tournament. The hotel is always immaculate and the staff works hard to make everything perfect. Plus, concierge is open in the morning on the weekends. That's a huge plus, since most places have concierge closed."
me and a friend stayed overnight for my twin brothers 30th birthday party. everyone from housekeeping (LAKEISHA) to guest services to breakfast were great. we didnt require much at all but if we did i know it would have been readily available to us..THANK YOU!!!!
Had a great stay for a business conference. Staff was polite and professional. Room was immaculate and cleaned daily. I appreciate and always utilize tgeir environment friendly towel policy. Would definitely stay when I am back in town.
Free shuttle service to and from the airport. Express check in. Very spacious rooms with sofa beds. Breakfast is included. They have food for pick up. The team is a bar. Shuttle will take you to local numerous restaurants.
Great free breakfast and lovely decor but pool was not available first night and internet WiFi NEVER worked...unacceptable for price charged
"We booked on Hotwire and we're thrilled with this very modern, sophisticated hotel. The room was nice with a great view of downtown Atlanta. The bathroom was tiny, though. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We'd love to stay there again!!"
The two bedroom suites fit our family of 6 perfectly fine. The free dinner and breakfast was an added treat and delicious plus free parking made this stay worth the value. It was definitely home away from home!
"I attended a large dinner. The venue was beautiful and no detail was overlooked. The food presentation was equally but tasted delicious, as well. The food is always good but was especially good this year."
Worse stay ever. Stole my wallet change the reservation without letting us know put us in a room with a broken air conditioner and then had to switch us to another room and then the housekeeper stole my wallet
Stayed at hotel for a friends wedding. Beautiful hotel with huge rooms and beautiful decor . Great customer service ! Great location in Buckhead and walking distance to lots of restaurants. Would definitely stay here the next time I am in Atlanta !
This hotel charges for breakfast but doesn't make you aware of it. I am extremely disappointed no one from the staff seem to care about what I felt. The place is clean I just felt the staff was very uncaring.
Thx. so much for your comments. We're so glad you enjoyed your dining experience and your stay during your conference. Please come back and stay with us again!
"This place was professional, beautiful, clean,  Full kitchen ( unexpected), comfortable, great location, free breakfast (awesome).  Would definitely stay again.  Trying now to find a reason to go back.  looooovvvvveed it"
"We are glad to hear that you found our hotel to be a cool little place to stay and like the loft type room.  We look forward to having you stay with us again in the near future.

Thanks,"
"This is a very pleasant hotel.  Staff is very attentive with great customer service.  Accross the street from Cobb Convention Center and shopping mall with restaurants and a Costco.  Large two room suites with two TV's
Great place to stay!"
"Hotel is in need of upgrades. There's a smell upon entering the hotel. The amenities are old, not correctly sized, not working or broken. Will not stay here again or recommend this location to and friends or family."
"I've stayed here many times over the years and the hotel is in the decline.....dirty carpet, worn furnishings, etc. Hallways are dark.  Also, safe wouldn't open and front desk never took care of it. Spend a little more and stay somewhere else."
All aspects of our stay at the Four Seasons - ATLANTA were the best.  I cannot say enough about the people and service that were extended to us during our stay.  I would select them again for any visit to Atlanta.
"We were able to check in earlier than expected.  We were greeted with super friendly vale services, and the people at the front desk were very nice.  Excellent accommodations.  I'd like to see breakfast provided for free."
"Rooms were very small, but seemed pretty clean. Hotel staff was very friendly. You canÃ¢ÂÂt beat this location especially if you are going to a show at the Fox Theater. Peachtree street is filled with great restaurants and beautiful buildings, churches and museums."
"Nice customer service! Checked in early. Room had blood stained sheets but once we told the front desk, they came immediately and changed our bedding! Thanks. Parking is $8/day. 2 room hotel. Large sitting area. Mini fridge, microwave, small sink."
We arrived at the Westin later than expected. The hotel was booked. The next morning I went to speak with the concierge about directions and they asked about our stay. I asked if they wanted the polite or real response. He replied
"hank you for your review and post, we're delighted to hear you had such a great experience and look forward to hosting you on your next trip to Atlanta!"
Heat was broken it was so cold also the housekeeping could have been better I had dirty glasses microwave dirty it didn't look like the same hotel that I stayed at in October 2016 I. Hope they get the heat fix
This hotel was great! The staff were super nice and very accommodating! Valet was great. Breakfast was good. The location was fantastic we were in walking distance to everything. Lastly the facility was very clean! Woukd definitely stay here again.
"Readily transportation to the airport was available. Guest services provided prompt delivery of extra towels, luggage carts were readily available, breakfast lines moved rapidly. I will definitely stay again in the future!"
Was a nice  clean modern hotel about 15 minutes to downtown atlanta.  Close to alot of shopping and restaurants .Breakfast was expensive and parking is $20.  Not really a family hotel. Geared more to adults.Would stay there again.
I was here for a conference and it was great. I ate some of the greatest food and over did it on the snacks. The staff was kind and genuine. Additionally the food was diverse and flavor full. Will come again soon.
Hotel was top notch.  Every beautiful inside and staff was friendly and helpful.  Food was fabulous.  The beds were more firm that I prefer but the pillows were so soft.  Room was kept very clean and check in and out were quick.
"Nice Westin hotel with great choices of restaurants, both at the hotel as well as in the immediate vicinity.  The hotel is also right next to a very nice mall, Lenox Square. Rooms are very comfortable and well equipped. Service was very good."
"This hotel is one of the best IÃ¢ÂÂve ever stayed in. The service was awesome! The shuttle service and convenience of the area was great, And the staff was some of the friendliest experienced at a hotel!"
Great hotel. We had plenty of space. The rooms were nice and clean and the staff were professional. They greeted us and talked to us. I would definitely be staying here again. Great customer service. A++++
"Good location, one of the nicest hotel staff I have ever encountered. Easy check in process. I arrived early and the front desk was accommodating and checked me in before 3:00pm. Location is great for nightlife and hotel room was very quiet."
Convenient and very nice accommodations!  Visiting son in area and we enjoyed dinner and a movie with in walking distance of the hotel.   The staff are wonderful and the accommodations are great too!!  I highly recommend staying at this location.
"I've stayed at a number of Embassy Suites over the years and normally they deliver with a great breakfast and happy hour.  While it is understandable that this Embassy Suite was under renovation, the condition and cleanliness of the room left much to be desired."
"I trust the Hyatt brand - This hotel is EXTREMELY BUSY, but the staff delivers personalized experiences. The area is central and the infused water was tasty. Room was large and spacious and guest services responded to a request in five minutes."
It was a six night stay and room condition and maintenance was impeccable. TV channel choices were adequate for a bit of relaxation. Location was awesome. Staff were polite and response was adequate for any queries I had.
Me and my girls visited for a weekend and rented a 2 qwn bed suite and a king and our rooms were amazing!!! Brandon at the front desk was very hospitable and even gave recommendations of things to do! Definitely gonna stay again!
"Convenient location, friendly and professional staff!  Fast internet and outstanding breakfast!  IcIcan go on and on.  Best value for your money.  Our room was clean and very pet friendly.  Will definitely stay again when we go back in Atlanta.  Thanks Homewood Suites!"
"Nice room clean, linens were nice, great views stayed on the 21st floor. could walk to restaurants, shopping Lennox Square is directly across the street! Valet parking was fast and easy never waited long for our car."
"Didn't know that there was such a hotel for the common man.  I felt like this was the Ritz for the common man. Breakfast Buffet, great bedding, quite rooms, indoor swimming pool, manager reception.    Move over Jedd Clampit"
"I am disappointed that you did not have a better experience, this is not typical of my hotel at all.  Please call me directly the next time you are traveling to Atlanta and  will personally ensure you have a terrific stay!  Joe Uhl 770 303-3186"
Stayed 3 nites. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was clean.  Shuttle driver was great and took me to my nearby business location. Across the street to the Lenox mall which was nice to wander after work was done for the day.
"The pros:  The location is SO convenient!
The cons:  Pool AND jacuzzi were (seasonally) inoperable, felt as if front desk staff were moderately polite, but otherwise disengaged.

Recommendation: Stay here if you must, but also consider the Renaissance Midtown for a VERY welcoming experience."
"I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely and peaceful the hotel is. It advertised as being under construction, but it NEVER felt that way. Very clean and appealing double queen room. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The food was excellent."
"We arrived late (approx. 11:00pm) and had a layover here. Nothing super fancy, but clean and efficient service for overnighters who had an early wake-up to catch a flight out. Appreciated the friendly service."
"We relocated to this hotel after a bad stay at another hotel in the area. The staff were all very kind and went above and beyond anything we could have asked. I definitely recommend this hotel. And, of course, the cookies were amazing!"
rooms were a bit dated but well maintained and clean. I am told that they have are renovating and have several renovated rooms in inventory. The staff really makes this place shine. My complements to the General Manager for w very well-trained staff
"Great staff.  Hotel is in middle of renovation, but staff more that offset any concerns over the construction. Restaurant and bar staff very attentive and friendly. Will definitely stay at this location again."
"First time here and everything was first taste. Service, food, room and location. Great gym with steam too!  Breakfast was also delicious. I've stayed in many luxury hotels and this one is great. I'll be back again soon."
"Clean appearance from lobby to room. Quiet ambiance, slept like a baby. Breakfast provided a great selection for what ever appetite you had, from fruits to cereals, eggs, sausages, and bacon. Friendly, cheerful and helpful service staff. Would definitely stay again."
We came to Atlanta for a funeral.  We used our reward points for the stay.  The counter service was ok.  The rooms were comfortable.  The hostess/server at the restaurant was great. Would stay there again.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre so glad you all joined us for a bite and time to unwind. Come back and visit us any time!
Everything was very clean and modern.  The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly.  The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. It was close to so many great restaurants and shopping. The pool is large and I loved the garden.
"We stay at this hotel every time we're in Atlanta.  Though there were a couple small issues on this last outing, we still love it.  The staff is awesome.  They are so nice and attentive. It's a major reason we keep coming back."
"We truly appreciate your comments and are so happy to hear that we made you feel like family during your recent stay with us.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon to enjoy our hotel and team.

Thank You,"
"Comfortable and clean. Miss having valet, fridge & microwave. Parking little crammed, but overall experience outweighed it and I would choose staying here again and my room option was perfect. That corner end  is the best"
Our room was clean (and I'm very picky) and comfortable. The only negative is that you have to pay a hefty parking fee unless you book online in advance through another company. The shuttle to the airport was timely and easy to use.
"The check in process was efficient and friendly.  The room was quiet, spacious with good bedding.  The hotel has an excellent fitness center for a hotel this size.  The location is excellent and the price was terrific for a midtown Atlanta hotel."
"This was the worst Embassy Suites we have ever stayed at!! Stains on the mattresses, holes in the doors, smelled like they were trying to hide something, the showers looked like they had dirt all around the edges from being so old."
"The pillows were small (5 for a kingsized bed), there was a damp bathmat hanging over the sink upon arrival. The toilet barely flushed and made awful noises. The sink was clogged. It was only for a night, so we just sucked it up."
Excellent accommodations.  Room was clean and well appointed. Staff was courteous and friendly.   Walked 2 blocks to dinner and felt safe in the whole area which is unusual for bigger cities.  Would recommend!
It was a nice little slice of the downtown/fast pace living with a touch of upscale living. A nice experience. The rooms  were trendy and the bed was like heaven. I would  definitely go there again just for night of fun.
"Thx. so much for your comments, and for being our guest. We're so glad our colleagues could be of service! Please come back and stay with us again the next time you're in Atlanta!"
Lakisha and Raynaldo were extremely awesome at the front desk! They gave us a complimentary card for a free drink and breakfast! They were such warm welcomers and were there for us if we needed anything!
"Clean, stylish but casual  dog friendly hotel with excellent staff. Location is a little out of the way but didnÃ¢ÂÂt matter much to my family. We hung around the area on Day 1 then went up to Sweetwater Creek ."
"Visited for work as convenient for my office. Looks good from the outside, reception and bar area look good but really let down by the room...cold, in bad need of paint job, new carpet, & new bathroom"
"This is a beautiful and trendy hotel in the center of Buckhead next to the train station. Trendy rooms, excellent rooftop patio, outstanding service, and overall an excellent experience throughout. Also good recognition of SPG guests."
check in by regina and mya was plesent my room was out standing  love the crabdipp everyone in restraint kind all my housekeeper did a nice job our 1 day visit in the regency club is always vice mary and tera was so kind
Bad experience the staff shouldÃ¢ÂÂve been way more concerned with my well being and making sure I was properly taken care of instead I felt rushed to get out and almost as if my money wasnÃ¢ÂÂt good enough cause my skin color
"This hotel has a park and fly program which makes it very convenient for early morning flights. Hotel has been updated and offers clean, comfortable  lodging. Complimentary airport shuttle service every 30 minutes. Pleasnt and helpful staff."
"The location of the hotel is too good, we went to attend the graduation ceremony in Georgia Tech which is within the walking distance. Curious & Experience staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my family & friends."
Staff was great and the octopus in the bar is VERY GOOD!  It was exactly what I would expect in a place of this caliber.  Everything that I needed was taken care of and the concierge had some great recommendations for places to eat nearby.
"Would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again, the staff is very professional, and friendly.  The room was clean and inviting and the bed was extremely comfortable.  This hotel is also very close to eateries, stores etc...excellent location."
I love coming to Atlanta for the 4th of July. Staying at the Hyatt Midtown is conveniently located in order for me to visit family and to enjoy all of the festivities. It is a good spot for a race view
"This is an amazing hotel, comfortable all the way, almost feels like home on the road. And there is the super friendly staff and great updated rooms, that make the travel an awesome experience!

The entire family

The location is perfect too!"
"The property was very clean and the room was quiet with a soft comfortable bed. Close to shopping and nice restaurants. I had a very pleasant stay. Although the parking was convenient, the parking deck is not well lit and overpriced."
"Beautiful hotel.

All of the staff, especially those who work at the front desk, accommodated all my special needs to the extent that they made the hotel feel like a home away from home. They are extremely courtesy and understanding."
"Best hotel in atl to me, quiet away from the city great rooms and bar close to airport, easy access to highway and plenty of food places great staff and valet option, great airport views and secluded."
The accommodations were excellent and the staff was top notch.  I can't imagine a higher quality option in the area.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for business or personal.  The staff seemed like they enjoyed working there.
"I would definitely stay here again.  Comfy bed, nice breakfast and evening snacks.  Very helpful and friendly staff. The front desk, valet service, housekeeping, and the ladies cooking breakfast were all great. Convenient location to a lot of downtown attractions. Enjoyed my stay."
"Great costumer service, clean modern rooms, and sweet location. Walking distance to many attractions like the Atlanta Aquarium and Coke tours, and many great restaurants. The only complaint is the expensive parking."
Stayed for a week with many baseball families for a baseball tournament. Could not have been a better property for such a trip with the spacious accomodations and being secluded but easily accessible. Very comfortable and the perfect property for a lengthy stay.
"We're lucky to have such an outstanding team, Rhonda, and I can't wait to share your lovely review with Alex. He'll be thrilled to hear you were so happy with the service you received. We'll see you the next time you visit Atlanta! 

Best, Daniel"
"Mandarin Oriental Atlanta exceeded every expectation for our leadership meeting of 23 people.  The location, rooms, catering, and meeting spaces were excellent and their staff anticipated our every need."
"I enjoyed my stay basically. Service was fantastic. Breakfast was good. Room was nice n clean. However, my sleep was not as restful as I would have liked. I love fresh air when I sleep but the window was glued shut."
"Clean room- passed my Ã¢ÂÂwhite wipe testÃ¢ÂÂ.  I travel with Clorox wipes and alcohol wipes to clean off every surface IÃ¢ÂÂll be touching and Loews  got an A+. Fast and good service when needed, close to great restaurants to walk to."
"The staff at this hotel was top notch. But the facilities were not up to RC standards. Rooms were dated, but very clean. The health club locker room didn't have a working a/c and in late July that can be uncomfortable."
"Very nice hotel! Great amenities! Quiet atmosphere... Great locations to restaurants and strip area! And Michelle A. Was absolutely wonderful, very pleasant and accommodating! I will stay here every time I visit Atlanta!!"
"Thx. so much for your review, and for being our guest. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us on your trip, and that our team could be of service during your stay. Please come back and stay with us again!"
"Thought I was getting a decent room for a reduced rate however,  the room had no refrigerator and no microwave. They expect guests to eat in the high priced restaurant or order high priced room service!"
"Efficient check in staff, very helpful and friendly. Hotel was very convenient to the airport with a bus service that runs every 15 minutes. Driver was helpful and friendly.  Nice clean room, quiet and comfortable."
"Easy check in and check out,  with friendly receptionist. Hotel allowed us to leave our bags in a holding place and our car in Valle until afternoon,  after we checked out. Room was clean. It was small,  but, nice enough. Everyone was friendly and helpful."
"First time staying at the Ritz-Carlton in Downtown Atlanta.  Fantastic hotel, very simply, you get everything you pay for!

Amazing location, fantastic service, cleanliness, service, all are top notch!

I would stay here again simply for the turndown service and mints :)"
Excellent service although dog barking next door was a bummer but silenced with one call to front desk.  Front desk staff exceptional and ease of using MARRIOTT web for reservation very easy and efficient
"Everything about this hotel surpassed all expectations from our late evening arrival, the comfortable room,the wonderful breakfast, great lunch, and especially the cocktail hour.  Although the guest computers were down, your desk clerk was happy to get our airline boarding passes."
"Ok...I've had stayed in many Homewood suites and this has to be the worst in dining in.
It was basically a wine and cheese and that is it.  No salad, no main course just wine, cheese and crackers. Sad stay"
Excellent hotel evening socials with food and drinks included Monday- Friday and morning hot breakfast nice friendly staff with very good customer rooms were very clean this is a must if you have family.
"Hotel was clean and comfortable. Staff was vert friendly & accommodating. Aquarium, World of Coke, and many other attractions were within easy & safe walking distance. Recommend a room on upper floors to enjoy the skyline views."
"Stayed three days while attending event at the convention center.  Amenities were disappointing.  Hotel was very clean. However, Room service very slow and order wrong half the time.  Internet is NOT free."
"Stan, we're so glad our team could be of service during your stay! We're very proud of our team! Come back when you can stay longer!"
"Excellent location for Aquarium, Coca-Cola Museum and other tourist spots.  Very accommodating staff, within walking distance of most. Parking on site, but expensive.  Hotel is very nice, clean and modern."
"Located downtown with many restaurant choices and within walking distance to the Georgia Aquarium,  Great customer service and beautiful hotel.  I loved the room, so stylish and comfortable bed too.  They spared no expense when decorating this hotel."
"We are glad to hear that you found us to be a very cool place to stay while in midtown.  We look forward to having you stay with us again for your next business or leisure trip.

Thank You,"
I really enjoyed staying here. Everyone was great! The bartender Will was fantastic. The food was delicious. The hotel was recently remodeled I believe. The shuttle service was very quick and on time.
"Worked out very well. We were here for a wedding in a nearby place and other members of the bride and groom's family  were staying here. Otherwise, I would't have been here. But, very satisfied, overall."
Hotel smelled like weed. And there were roaches in the room Air didn't work. parking was 25 a day that was for garage. and the spaces was so tight.fghrtjudkhgzdsfvgearygeGFDGREY5YREYHTRHRTHRTZSRAT5HZSTHRT5H
"Will definitely stay at this hotel in the future! Very warm staff, from management to kitchen. I was greeted twice with a ""can I give you a hug?""  We enjoyed the evening social very much, and looked forward to mingle."
"Hotel very nice, clean and well kept. Parking fees I think are outrageous. One should never have to pay for parking.
Hotel reception not very attentive  to their clients.
Restaurant waitresses for the breakfast buffet are excellent and very friendly."
Yolanda Cottoy is an amazing Conference  Planning Manager!  Her attention to every detail and enthusiasm for the success of the event and the parntership with the client makes her a superstar in the hospitality industry.  #BRAVO
"Thrilled to hear that our Front Desk team was able to help you, we appreciate you and thanks for the nice comments"
Great rooms. Clean. Very comfortable beds.  Extraordinary staff (southern hospitality at its best). I strongly recommend. This was a 3 day business conference and the venue was excellent. Great location.
"The hotel is great located, has comfortable rooms, well equipped gym and the restaurant is great! It is has great breakfast options without making you have a buffet breakfast and service from Belene is amazing!!!"
"This hotel was family friendly, everyone was welcoming of myself with four children, we were comfortable and the breakfast was really good. I would choose his hotel again if I am in the area. Great stay"
"The cooperation of the banquet staff for set up, service, and food was especially great. Harry was extremely helpful in our conference set up.  Many thanks to him and the rest of the staff. Our room was comfortable, quiet, and the housekeeping staff was wonderful."
"Would go back anytime, the service was awesome, and the staff was catering to all our needs (USDA Family, thanks you guys at Wyndham Atlanta Galleria, rock"
"Kamisha was very professional, accommodating and sweet. You are lucky to have her as apart of your staff. My husband and I have visited this location twice and this was our first time using valet, we have no regrets thanks to kamisha!"
This is an amazing hotel in the middle of midtown ATL.  Great rooms and accommodations.  There are plenty of great restaurants around this area and the bar in the lobby is great too.  Will stay here again.
"Tyler the Desk clerk --- Awesome, helpful, offered great suggestions.
Matthew the Driver --- better than a 10. If they do not get this young man in management training ASAP someone else will.  Overall - the staff was excellent but highlighted by Tyler and Matthew."
"Comfortable and quiet.  A few things that were not up to snuff with the other DoubleTree properties but small and almost not worth mentioning.  Friendly staff.
All in all I have been back to this property and I'm sure I'll be back again."
"Everything in order. Nice rooms, excellent view. Only the bathroom is a bit small. Breakfast is ok. Had a good nights rest. Location in the centre with good acces to Olympic area. Shos and restaurants nearby."
The kitchen is located in front of the ground floor rooms.  It sounds like a construction zone at 6am.   I would move hotels before staying on that floor again.   Other than that it was a nice hotel for the cost of the stay.
"Everything about my stay was perfect. The staff was helpful, the service was great, the food hit the spot, the room was comfortable, transportation options were plentiful - I couldn't have asked for more."
The staff is rude and not willing to help customers.  They transfer your several times for simple questions (such as how late the restaurant is open) and then give you the wrong information.  Go elsewhere.
"What lovely welcoming staff. Very helpful.
Very clean, what you would expect from this standard of hotel.
The hotel is positioned not far from all the need to do/see/get attractions.
Would highly recommend this hotel."
"After staying at the Intercontinental in Austin Texas, this hotel was a breath of fresh air. Incredible atmosphere with the staff in particular. Very welcoming and supportive. Providing information. Really very friendly. Makes a huge difference to visitors like myself."
this was an excellent hotel to stay in.  very modern setup.  we booked the hotel with a package deal to the Georgia aquarium.  it was about 6 blocks away.  we received free valet parking with the package also.  we will stay here again
The property and staff are excellent .  I have stayed here several times and it is wonderful. The rooms are spacious and clean.  The staff is professional and very efficient.  The gym is modern and offers several machines.
"Martha, we're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us for the fitness event! What a fun group! Thx. so much for being our guest. Please come back again the next time you're in Buckhead!"
"Everything was perfect. The staff was polite, professional and courteous. The location was very close to everything, convenient to shopping and restaurants. the housekeeping staff went above and beyond"
Excellent stay - staff helpful and courteous - always willing to assist - breakfast and the evening meal were prepared hot and very delicious.  Good location to shopping and the interstate.  Parking was no issue and the grounds were clean.
"I had a great stay at this hotel, while construction/renovations were going on at this location.  I would highly recommend this hotel, not because of the location, but how the people are so nice and friendly."
It was a really nice place close to just about anything you want to do.the people are very nice and helpful will stay there again the breakfast was also good.the room was great bathroom was a little small but it was still a good stay
"Absolutely beautiful building and rooms.  Everyone was extremely nice and professional - made us feel welcomed.  The rooms are clean, unique, and comfortable with nice decor.  We love it!  Very convenient for anyone looking to stay in the city."
"You will love your stay. Hotel is beautiful, rooms clean, beds are very comfortable and staff is professional and friendly. If you are a breakfast eater and enjoy a good hot breakfast don't buy the breakfast. I would suggest you go out and get breakfast."
"We are glad to hear that you found the hotel to be quaint and comfortable as well as finding our team to be friendly and pleasant.  We look forward to having you stay with us again in the near future.

Thank You,"
Beautiful hotel in the style of Frank Lloyd Wright. Not a cookie cutter hotel but a very relaxing atmosphere. The room was comfortable with great food in the restaurant. Good location to surrounding interests.
"An outstanding place to stay. It was our first visit to Suntrust Park and the hotel was very accommodating. Complimentary ride to the ballpark, rooms were spotless, staff very informative and courteous, and breakfast served till 0930. We highly recommend and will be back!"
It was great to have you back! WeÃ¢ÂÂre always down to give you a warm welcome and a lift. We hope youÃ¢ÂÂll visit again soon!
"Great stay, good food, super nice staff, clean rooms, and extremely comfortable beds to the point we want to buy one for our home. Parking is interesting and a bit pricey but overall, we would absolutely stay here again!"
"Traveling for business, needed someplace close to our meeting facility. Grabbed a late dinner at the bar, the food was great and service was even better. Everyone was extremely polite and as I was leaving, the bellhop thanked me for staying there."
"Clean, updated, excellent staff.  Very attentive and know your name.  Valet parking, don't have to search for parking. Easy access to other places to dine and night life. Hotel dining experience was minimum regarding choices and full meal in the evening."
"Had a weekend in Atlanta for sightseeing.  The staff was competent.  The room was well appointed with a great view and bed.  The only issue with the room, it was a little small.  We would stay again in a larger room."
Needed to spend a night near the ATL airport and not spend a fortune. The have around the clock free transport back and forth to the airport which was painless and easy.  Everybody was courteous and friendly. Free wifi.
"This hotel is well appointed and the Breakfast menu has a very good selection and good quality. This hotel is very close to the Georgia World Conference Center. Room was clean an well appointed including a microwave, Range top, refrigerator and utensils."
"Great room and great customer service.Steps to market .
Valet service with a smile.
Really nice staff.
Room comfy and modern style. Nice small bar.
No bath tub  (sigh), but shower ok. Love bliss products."
Staff was great . Hotel was clean and suitable for my Needs . Thank you staff . Great and comfortable beds and large Shower hot water worked great . Check in process was quick and easy and very professional staff .
"The Hotel was immaculate, staff was friendly, we were here for Braves game which
 is just a Ten minute walk away! We were upgraded to an executive Suite, so roomy. Love the AVEDA products and the beautiful view from our room"
I enjoyed my stay . The only thing that I didn't get to use is the WiFi because I didn't have any points . Everything else was great. The breakfast was the best I have experienced in  any hotel ever. Also reasonable parking.
"We're so glad you found us for your recent stay in Buckhead. We truly appreciate your review and your assessment of us as a ""GEM"". We consider your kind words a ""GEM"" and will post them for the whole team to enjoy. Thank you."
It doesn't get much better than this hotel! Great location with plenty of things to access in Atlanta. The room is very relaxing and the most comfortable bed ever!. The accommodated every request we have ever.
Over all we had great experience staying at this hotel. The whole staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms were very spacious and always clean. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel if you are looking to stay in the Bulkhead area.
"Best business meeting experience I've encountered in a long time. All of the staff are exceptionally professional, helpful and friendly.  Facilities are in great shape and well furnished.  Food was very good too."
"This hotel is a consistent H Garden branded hotel with good focus on service. Hotel is clean with friendly staff, good MTO breakfast. Great location to Midtown dining and bars and is within striking distance of downtown. Would stay here again."
"The staff was accommodating and friendly. Public spaces are roomy and clean. We am attended an event at the conference center and our expectations were exceeded. The buffet food was good, but I've had better. I would certainly recommend using this hotel for events again."
"This is our 2nd year staying at the hotel during a large event.  The hotel staff was wonderful, the rooms are well kept and very comfortable.  The complimentary breakfast is always good compared to other hotels I have stayed at."
Trendy and clean!  Arrival and pre-arrival was seamless and easy.  The place itself is in great shape and exciting. My kids loved it which are somewhat hard to please sometimes. The breakfast was delightful!
"Was a great place to stay.  Very friendly and helpful staff, always greeting you.  Location near a shopping and restaurant area.  Great restaurant within the hotel.  Food was great!  Wooded area outside for walks and leisure time."
I got stranded after a flight delay.  Ended up booking last minute.  Very accommodating.  Great king bed. Beautiful lobby and delightful staff!!! Bonus....airport shuttle.  Free internet.  Checked in right away at 11pm.
"The Atlanta Marriott Marquis is one of my favorite conference hotels on the east coast. I can attest that if you aren't attending an event at the property, it can be quite overwhelming. Friendly staff, nice rooms and great conference spaces."
Nice location close to mall. Layout minimizes big city feel while still being in a happening place. I will most likely stay again at this location again as my prior stay here was just as good the second time.
Beds were uncomfortable.  Rooms smelled horrible.  Valet was not optional and cost $45.   I was surprised how outdated the rooms were.  I always thought Omni was a good brand.  Never staying there again.  Absolute waste of money.
I do not have much to say here except for the rooms and service are outstanding! Stay here if you want exceptional accommodations. Rates for the area are good and staff is friendly. Perfect for access to the Atlanta International convention center.
"Construction And odors from paint and glue were strong. No food / accessories avail at a desk store due to construction . Wi Fi was horrible, could not even check email from room. Place was in disarray"
"Only stayed one night, staff was pleasant, we had a 2 bedroom suite and couldn't ask for anything more  in a room...would definitely return.  Conveniently located to Center Stage within walking distance.  Great place if you want to stay close to there"
"We are truly sorry that you had these experiences. We would like to talk to you. Can you please email us at contact@ellishotel.com or call 404 523 5155 and ask for me?

Sincerely, 

Mr. Kim Kleisner 
General Manager"
It was a positive stay and I enjoyed the service and attention to detail. I was fortunate to get in during non peak season and the location is more than desireable.  I will continue to stay there when IÃ¢ÂÂm in Atlanta
The location of the hotel is great as well as the room......just dont expect any service.  Next will try the new W Hotel in midtown.
"Perfect place to stay if youÃ¢ÂÂre flying on a quick trip to Atlanta and visiting a place close by, like the Porsche Experience! Use the Skytrain and Uber, no cars needed. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not cheap though, but first class service."
We're so very sorry to hear your room experience was not up to our standards. We've passed your comments on to our team. You may also reach out to us directly as well at qualityatlra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay.
Stayed one night as a layover between flights.  A comfortable and clean hotel with a free train link to the airport.  Excellent breakfast so ensure you book the Bed and Breakfast deal.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.
We would like to thank you for continually coming back to our hotel the Embassy Suites Hotel Atlanta Airport. Your review is greatly appreciated.
"A very well appointed hotel and the customer service especially makes a stay here outstanding.  From the person who cleaned our room, to the staff in the buffet breakfast everyone was friendly and went out of their way to make our stay special."
"I travel a lot, and your staff was exceptional.  Very accommodating and helpful. So friendly, I loved my stay I will definitely return there when IÃ¢ÂÂm back in Atlanta. You have a great culture across the entire staff."

"Very nice hotel in midtown. Great room. Modern lobby. Very quiet. Definitely a place to recommend when kn Atlanta. 
Very nice bathroom with shower. Lighting is a little limited especially for shaving/make up."
Charlie is hands down the best hotel driver I've ever used! Keep him around and give that man a raise! He made our whole trip and without him we would have been out quite a bit of money in lyft rides. Thanks again bud!
Stayed here for a business trip. Nice update to hotel. The bed was very comfortable!!! Rooms were clean. The staff was friendly. Not a fan of the breakfast.. wish places had lactose free milk!! Only complaint was the tissues were never refilled.
"The room was completely awesome. Location was nice. Personal was super nice also. No cons, ratio price/benefits is super high. The gym and pool area is also convenient.
I see no cons on this hotel. I would definitely return."
"This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel and every time is a great experience. The staff is extremely courteous and well trained.  Atmosphere is sophisticated, and the food is excellent as well. Looking forward to my next experience with them!"
"Great location, great service! Definitely would stay again. The breakfast  buffet had a nice selection for just about any guest. Bed and pillows were very comfortable. One of the most important factors in choosing this property was the FREE parking."
Very new and clean environment. Breakfast is more than expected and staff is highly trained. We come every year and although there has been renovations it has always been the best place to lay your head and enjoy a free reception and breakfast.
"The noise in the room was horrible. I could hear the guest next to me shower, the air unit was loud and not working properly. The room had an mildew smell and the coffee makers needs to be updated. However the staff was very nice"
I needed a place to spend the night after surgery at nearby hospital so to be close by for any complications and early post op appointment.  The staff was friendly and accommodating and I felt very comfortable and peaceful there.
"Hotel itself is fine; however, the housekeeping and services by them are very sub par.  It's close to the airport and to the main highway.  A few restaurants within walking distance.  If given the opportunity, stay at Embassy Suites."
"Nice, clean, comfortable bed.  Staff very helpful.  Nice exercise facility, wireless internet available in rooms."
"My wife and I stayed here for the weekend (18th-20th May 2012) and we loved it. The room was very clean and spacious with a full kitchen, the staff were friendly and helpful. We will defenely stay here again in the future."
We loved everything about our stay here! From the outgoing and friendly staff to the room with a view. The food at The Community restaurant was fantastic. I would go there to eat even if I lived in the city.
"Modern, clean rooms, a wonderful breakfast, and convenient to restaurants, the airport, and the freeway - all at a great price (particularly with the World of Hyatt reward program rate). The rooms are very spacious, with huge TVs and sofas."
The hotel is clean and quiet we slept like babies! The four mornings we were there the breakfasts were very tasty. The staff remembered us by name and were extremely helpful. We stayed here for dragoncon and it was close enough to just walk.
"The Staff and hotel were excellent. Very professional in every way possible. Room was well prepared and all items were attended to.
No problems with anything everything was first rate. We would highl recommend this property."
"Stayed in this hotel 2 times. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, comfort, the whole area is green, next to the hotel is a wonderful lake where you can walk or run in the morning ... I really enjoyed it."
"Great staff, great food and the rooms are excellent! The location could not be better, Buckhead offers everything from outstanding shopping to excellent restaurants!  If you are looking for the TOTAL package when traveling to the Atlanta area, this is your place!"
Great hotel with a warm friendly home-like atmosphere.  The staff did a wonderful job with being friendly and professional.  They were very accommodating and resourceful.  I look forward to my next stay at Homewood Suites.
I stayed here for business travel. The internet speed was pretty good. The staff was friendly and nice. They had a pretty good breakfast. The location is very close to where I was working. I will most likely go back.
"Other than complaining about the airplane sized bathrooms this is one of the nicer hotels. Rooms are comfortable. WiFi is easy and fast.
Nice view of City and close to Good food and easy walk to many locations."
"Great location and price. Would def stay again
staff is lovely parking a pleasure."
Huge  bathroom and  kitchen/living room.  Modernistic and comfortable.  Great gym . Friendly  and  polite staff. One  of the best  rooms in which we have stayed and  recommend it highly.
"We are huge fans of the brand and this hotel was no disappointment.  clean, good staff, good location.  I remember staying here as a kid.  Now as an adult it was just as pleasing and a great value.  We would definitely stay again."
Great place in midtown Atlanta. Only half a block from piedmont park. Pool was small but service was prompt and friendly. Check in was smooth and check out time is 12 noon. Next time I am going to try W in down town Atlanta.
"Overall Loews was a pleasant experience. Upon checking in, the front desk and concierge staff were pleasant.  The rooms were a fair size, quiet and very clean. Great location - within walking distance to the Botanical Garden."
Stayed here for momocon 2018 and had a great experience as usual. Double room suite fit me and 6 other friends comfortably. Complimentary breakfast is great too because it is one less meal to have to worry about.
Our family held it's reunion at this hotel. The staff was professional and courteous. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Our server always had a smile and was extremely polite and helpful. I would reccommend this hotel.
The service and atmosphere was GREAT!!!!! I will be back and I am also recommending this hotel to all my friends!!!! It was a great experience. It had just been renovated and looks like a brand new hotel.
"Great experience and was located central to the event.  Look forward to staying here again for next year's convention!  Early check in was great, check out was easy and the electronic request for my vehicle in valet parking was exceptional."
The manager contacted me about my concerns. I thought that was awesome . The customer service is awesome. The condition of location didn't meet my family expectations. If the rooms are updated and odor free. This location will definitely match the price of rooms.
The hotel's overall appearance is fine. The staff is okay.  The rooms are not well kept and there were roaches everywhere! I could never get comfortable because of the roaches. I will never stay here again.
"Excellent stays.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  Worked on an eight month job in the area, so stayed at least every other week and were only disappointed if there were no vacancies when needed."
"This hotel has it all and is in a great location. It is extremely close to the airport and downtown all at the same time. Not only are the rooms spacious and comfortable, but the staff is what tops off your experience."
"Excellent hotel and staff! Always friendly and accommodating! From check in, concierge, board room, cleaning and restaurant staff were very helpful, professional and friendly!! To feel safe in a clean hotel makes all the difference!!!"
"I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the best hotel would be that offered a separate sleeping area and an indoor pool. COuldn't be happier, and the value was great.  Nobody wanted to leave :-)"
"Nice hotel, good staff and clean room.  We would stay hera again and plan to in the future.  It's near everything from the stadium to the World Congress Ctr and any other places you'd like to go.  Parking was a little expensive however."
Went to go see braves baseball great stay for convenience to the game and nightlife pool was chilly thou safe and has free shuttle to get places would stay there again price was perfect probably be back soon to check out new stadium
Best location for a great experience. In the middle of almost everything that you might not need a car at all if your biz is at GA World Convention Center unless you want to go to their premium stores for shopping.
I needed to workin my room so I ordered room service. I young lady who brought it was Rocha and she was so very polite and very happy to answer questions that I had about the area.  She was so very helpful.
"This is a wonderful hotel, a great mix between southern hospitality and luxury. I stay here at least three times a year and have never been disappointed. The staff and accommodations are exceptional.
Great location in Atlanta."
Great environment in which to conduct business and not worry about your accommodations or safety.   Excellent restaurant and market on the premises with others in adjacent facility.  Staff was attentive to all of our needs.
"Felt like an apartment with all the facilities and less of a hotel. Equipped with a functional kitchen and even utensils, couches. Clean and well maintained. Staff are friendly, there is a bar and some vending machines too."
"What a wonderful welcome back to the United States after a long, all day flight from Europe!  Close by the airport with free shuttle, great fitness center, and phenomenal free breakfast.  Room was clean, cozy, and bed was comfortable."
Very clean. Staff extremely nice. Perfect for a long stay. Location is good and close to chain restaurants plus a shopping mall. Not far from I285 and I75.   The bathroom was a good size and spotless. Shower was very roomy.
No pool or room service. We had a newly renovated room which was clean. The room was dark with low lighting. Due to construction it was loud at times. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Some what over priced.
I am not sure why there are reservations when you can't check in when you arrive after 3:00 PM. We also had to change rooms due to broken AC. We almost missed our dinner reservation due to multiple problems.
We would like to apologize for the smoke smell in your room but are happy you had an otherwise good stay. Thank you and we hope to see you again in the future.
My family and I stayed here before flying out the next day as its right by the airport.  Michelle Azizari was so helpful and accommodating.  She really made our stay a pleasure.  We'll be back because of her.
"Nice rooms, great service. Breakfast is okay but expensive. The service there is the best. The hot tub had a LOT of chlorine that burned our eyes & was not very clean. The indoor pool was nice but not very deep."
Our visit to the Hyatt Place in Downtown Atlanta was excellent.  The staff were very friendly and most accommodating.  The location was perfect and the complimentary breakfast was satisfactory.  Shuttle service and drivers were extremely accommodating.
"I was at the W hotel for a group meeting.  The room is contemporary and comfortable. Typical modern glass bathroom which is fine....Great food! Nice meeting rooms, and great service...I would stay here again"
I stayed here for a conference that I was attending downtown.  Great location close to Marta. Lots of great places to eat nearby. Hotel very clean. Staff friendly. Would definitely recommend staying here again. Loved it
Custom drinks at the bar. Calvin is amazing! Also the beds were comfortable and the conference accommodations were adequate. We came down from Kentucky but would love to stay here again! Thank you Calvin for a great bar experience!
Although it was an overnight stay it was cozy & comfortable.  The customer service provided a southern hospitality atmosphere.  The room was very clean & king bed was very comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this hotel!
"Great location to do the City Pass, easy walks for small children. Great breakfast options. Our room was a little noisy in the early morning with truck traffic, but the location was so good we wouldn't change anything."
The views from the room is great! Theres a beautiful zen garden that is very relaxing if you want to explore throughout the hotel. Spa was also relaxing with sauna and steam room. Friendly and helpful staff from beggining of the stay to the end.
"I usually like Double Tree Hotels but this one was terrible, dirty rooms and just old.  Coffee pot was dirty, floor when i would walk on it actually had dust come up, littered with stains and rips and bathroom tub slimy....gross"
Was a very nice stay.I enjoyed the bar area where they had a starbucks. Staff was friendly nice and accomadating. Rooms were clean and large and the bed..very comfortable. We loved it. Will go again. You just can't go wrong at a Grand Hyatt.
"Have stayed here several times when in for a convention. Comfortable, clean hotel. Recently renovated. Not impressed with room service food, but other than that, pleased with all aspects. Convenient location, shuttle service very helpful."
Good hotel. Great location...plenty of shopping and restaurants right outside the hotel door.  Lobby tends to be noisy due to bar location in center of lobby.  Rooms okay for the price.  Hotel personnel helpfula nd very friendly. Bottom line is recommendation due to location.
"The Hotel is in the middle of Peachtree street, rooms are very clean and well equipped. I have used also the fitness center and itÃ¢ÂÂs really good. There is a valet parking very efficient. All was perfect during our stay. Perfect for families."
This hotel is strategically located near sporting and tourist attractions.  The best part of my stay was the customer service - excellent! Counter staff very accommodating and valets remarkable as the would run back and forth to be timely.  Incredible!
"Overall, this hotel is just... tired. The room was not clean. The beds were atrocious (sink holes, sloping, and uncomfortable). The pools were ok, but there were no towels and the locker rooms smelled of urine!"
"I made last minute plans to stay in Atlanta the night before my flight home. The hotel is conveniently located off I-280, had ample parking and check-in was quick. I has a comfortable night's rest which is exactly what I was looking for."
"Everyone is so helpful, hotel was very clean.  Many convenient options (restaurants, drug store, grocery store) around the hotel plus limited but good choices if you prefer to eat on property. Bed was comfortable."
I had a very good experience at this Doubletree. Staff members were very friendly and helpful. The property was in top notch condition. Food and beverage services were good. It was an exceptional experience. I'll stay here again.
Very nice hotel in the center of Midtown. The rooms are nice with great views. The doorman was very accommodating and the housekeeping staff went out of their way to help with our special requests. Will be back!
"Rooms and property were clean & staff friendly and helpful.  Room was quiet, even though there was a large number of youth staying for the weekend.  This property is tired but the location is great.  Will definitely stay again."
"I enjoyed the room for a family a five. However, getting to the room posed an issue. The hotel smelled like animals and the breakfast buffet did not have meat. Kids were gambling in the lobby. The cameras will show that clearly."
"Quite Superb hotel with wonderful staff and facilities 
The gym and the fitness classes were an added bonus 
Breakfast is great and anyone who stays here should try the Georgian Eggs Benedict as it is a delight"
"On our way to Florida, we stopped at this hotel to stay the night. The hotel was easy to find. The room was big and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my stay at this hotel with the family."
Stayed here before catching a flight out. Used the stay and fly package and it worked out great. The service was great and the room more than met my needs. Free breakfast was adequate and the free amenities this hotel offers is hard to beat.
"Basic airport accomodations near airport.  Shuttle was slow picking us up, but on time taking us back to the airport.  Reasonably clean and quiet for the price.  Would probably look for other accomodations next time there was a stay over at the Atlanta airport."
We really loved this place. The rooms were clean and the all the staff were extremely nice. Especially the cleaning staff and the restaurant. Lovely atmosphere! We had a great time. Thank you!!! We highly recommend staying here. This place is amazing.
"I had a blast with my family ! The hotel was exquisite along with friendly staff, especially Ishrat Mahmud. She was so sweet and helped us with anything we had questions on. We plan on coming back. Ã°ÂÂÂ"
We are thrilled to know that you enjoyed your stay with us! Thank you
Excellent for business in downtown Atlanta.  Staff were extremely friendly.  Good breakfast.  Very small bathroom but great location and hotel.  Economical too.  Best staff around. Walking distance to much plus shuttle service available. B
Hotel was clean and staff was friendly. Very convenient from the airport shuttle service was prompt and efficient. Jennifer at the front desk was super helpful and friendly. She really made the stay mush more enjoyable after traveling for 2 days straight!
"Wonderful place to have a reunion, we were a very, very large group the dinner was excellent, the servers were on point at all times, and the banquet hall was beautiful.  We had an excellent time of enjoyment."
Superb accommodations & excellent staff. Marvelous at reconciling issue with noisey neighbors & their child. Upgraded our room to avoid confrontation with people next door. Valet and luggage handlers were top notch. Rooms were impeccable and balcony views onto Suntruat Park were unbelievable.
Overall Great Experience! No problems and enjoyed my stay. The hotel from the check in to the checkout was superb! Looking forward in a few months to come back for my stay. The complimentary breakfast was good and the evening social as well.
"I would recommend this Hotel. The rooms are large and clean, and Beds are comfortable. Staff are great and friendly. Hotel is walking distance to Cumberland Mall and to variety of good restaurants.  Great location for business and leisure travelers."
This Hyatt hotel was a pleasurable place to stay for the week I was in Atlanta for a conference. Many eateries and attractions close by. I will definitely choose to stay here again while in the Atlanta area.
Everything was great especially the friendly staff. The only thing I wish they had was a patio of some sort to get some sunshine after being inside all day for business purposes. I would definitely stay here again.
Clean comfortable rooms. Beds were very comfortable. linens were clean. Easy check in and out. Bar has a wide variety of drinks and local craft beer.  Great service from bar staff. located near many excellent restaurants.
We enjoyed every aspect. Staff was professional and friendly!! The family members had a great compliments about the awesome breakfast as well as the reception. Our banquet help was superb as well as our meet and greet.
"Very accommodating, friendly, and professional staff. They definitely went above and beyond to make us comfortable. Room was immaculate. Love the breakfast as well. No complaints at all! Will definitely return!"
Well maintained hotel with a caring and friendly staff. Nice breakfast buffet with cooked to order items available. Ample parking. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed. The bartender mixed great drinks!
The JW Marriott is a first class hotel with awesome service. On top of that the location is right next door to the Lenox Mall and a Marta Station is just a half block walk. I much prefer this property to anything downtown.
Love having frig & microwave in room...  Midtown location is very convenient.   Helpful and friendly staff. It must be a good place to work because all of the employees seemed to be very happy and concerned with our satisfaction
"The room was older but updated and the space was great. I could see down to the courtyard which was nice, and from the loft view I could see several skyscrapers. The staff was pleasant and very willing to assist with any requests."
"My company has a meeting here every year.  Great for meetings, nice rooms, and excellent customer service.  Super close to Atlanta Braves Sun Trust Park.  The only thing I personally would like is a walk on shower.  Not a fan of tub/shower."
Everything a Ritz should be. My daughter spent her 13 birthday with friends here they made her feel so very special. Look forward to many more trips and time at the Ritz as it is truly an enjoyable experience
"Wow. Thank you Caroline for your kind words! We're happy to hear that our team could provide you with a wonderful experience and that you found our team to provide genuine hospitality throughout your entire stay. We hope to welcome you back, soon. Safe travels."
"I had a great time. Hotel was inviting, staff was friendly and very professional. The room had a beautiful view of buckhead!  The bedding was unmatched, I slept better than I have in years, I can't wait until the next time."
"We arrived early, our room wasn't ready and Ashley, who was working the front desk, did everything possible to find a room for us. She was incredibly attentive and kind to a group of very tired travelers."
The hotel is very convenient to the Sky Train at the airport but is expensive for what you get.  There are others hotels close by that I would try next time.  It's confusing getting to the hotel---definitely use GPS.
Michelle was awesome and made our honeymoon the best. My wifeÃ¢ÂÂs birthday was Wednesday and she surprised her with a honeybun.    Atlanta is the place to be and we coming back tomorrow for sure.      Thank you Michelle
"clean spacious rooms with nice a view of the Atlanta area. great food, and comfortable gym accessories. within walking distance of great restaurants and fun filling entertainments. Transportation available for the Marta use."
Came to  Buckhesd for cooking classes at Sur La Table. The Ritz was the perfect location for an overnight stay. Room was upgraded to an executive suite...absolutely wonderful. Had breakfast at the Gallery...everything was cooked to perfection. Great stay!
"I stayed at this property a few times for work over the summer and enjoyed it very much. The service was always good, staff courteous, rooms spacious/clean and food good. Each time I returned, they recognized me! I highly recommend."
The lighting in the room was really dim and beds needs an upgrade felt like a blow up mattress. The rooms didn't have microwaves or fridge nor was a complimentary breakfast offered. Hotel should consider upgrading a little bit.
The staff were so nice... my unfortunate night was due to dirty filters and my allergies to dust. I have stayed in several Hyatt hotels and hope this is an isolated event that gets taken care of soon.
"I was there for a small (~75 business conference).  This place is ok not great.  Rooms and staff were nice.  Super small lobby, very small conference area and an unimpressive restaurant.  As the rating suggests it is average."
"The location of the hotel to cowboy stadium, the friendliness and professionalism of the staff were positives. Negatives were the broken elevator, out of order business computers in the lobby, broken ice machine on my floor and my phone in my room didn't work."
"4 days of weed smoke in the hallways, rooms and elevators. Security did nothing knowing it was coming from room 1021. Great hotel for pot smokers not for children staying in the hotel. Disappointed my son had to breath fumes for 4 days!!"
I stayed at this hotel at the beginning of September for a four day business trip. The location is unbeatable. The hotel is clean and the main entrance is newly remodeled. The rooms could stand some upgrading but are also clean.
"Went to grab breakfast this morning & Mary was amazing!! She was very helpful & made some of the best eggs IÃ¢ÂÂve ever had. Nice & clean eating area, service was incredible. Definitely would love to come back here again."
The location of this hotel is perfect for an overnight stay when attending an Atlanta Braves game or event at the Coca Cola Roxy. You are a short walk away from the venue and stadium. The hotel is clean and the staff are very helpful.
"My wife and I stayed here for the college playoff game. This property is very clean and modern. The staff was very professional and polite. The fitness center, while not large, is adequate for a quick workout."
Our stay was great and we will stay there the next time we are in Atlanta. We were there to attend an Atlanta Braves baseball game.  Atlanta won 2 out of 3. The food was great and the service as great as well.
"This hotel is stunning with the central atrium and glass elevators. On-site event rooms are great. Fitness room is also very nice. However, the door of the room next to mine slammed loudly each time it was used."
Excellent view and luxury Bedding! Loved all the appointments within room! I cannot wait to stay here again with my husband. I was here for business as a wedding photographer. Excellent customer service!
"We enjoyed our stay, everything was clean, food was good. Especially enjoyed the 3 free beverages at dinner. Will recommend to family and friends. Also, was pleased to learn of parking for the airport and shuttle ride."
"To sum it up, there was a huge cockroach in the shower, my old food never was picked up and sat outside my door for two days, there are no microwaves in the room so I wasted a lot of food and money unnecessarily."
"Great location next to Mall.  Currently under renovation, but the crew was very quiet.  The food is really good and rooms are very clean and accommodating.  The staff needs positive boosts to increase the guest satisfaction."
finding the hotel entry is a little tricky; the rooms are clean and spacious; everyone on the staff I interacted with was friendly.  They over-apologized for changing the room locks during my stay...but it wasn't an inconvenience at all. Nice place
Front Desk staff was great and very attuned to providing a high level of service!  Elizabeth was spot on for anything we needed and she personally checked via text if we were satisfied with everything and taken care of. It was a great visit!!
"-Hallways were filthy, food, trash, etc all down hallway. 
-Sheets were dirty, I'm guessing they were not changed between the previous occupants and us. 
-They promise a free cocktail in evening from 530-630pm but then when I went to bar they said they "
This hotel is two blocks away from Sun Trust Park and the surrounding Battery.  Valet parking is required but hotel uses a text method to request your vehicle.  Central location to many restaurants and within walking distance to Galleria Mall
"Amazing time, stayed here for a week for work. Food is amazing, great breakfast and Mary makes a great omelette. Janet is friendly and a joy to talk to. If I am ever in Atlanta again this will be where I am staying again."
Such a beautiful hotel. We stayed there for two nights and had a wonderful time. Beds were very comfortable. Room service food was delicious- lobster rolls and Creme brÃÂ»lÃÂ©e. The use of the hotel car was very convenient.
Best Hotel in the Buckhead area.  Staff is on their toes and the check-in and check-out process is a breeze.  Food is always very good and fresh.  They even begin contact with you before to arrive to arrange any special needs or requests.
"Hotel is nice somewhat dated rooms, but nice overall.  It's a good hotel with great service, coffee shop, decent restaurant and overall a good experience. The highway side rooms are somewhat noisy but ok."
Beautiful and spacious rooms within walking distance to shopping and dining. Free parking and free breakfast made this a very valuable place to lodge. The room was lovely with all the amenities you could ask for. Truly enjoyed our stay.
"From getting out of the taxi, through check-in, the room and breakfast, service was outstanding.  The staff are genuinely interested in helping guests.  The room was very comfortable and spacious and the breakfast was fresh.  I look forward to visiting again."
Got woke up by a staff member before check out time when me and my fiance  was having quality time n wasn't even dressed  so this wasnt what I was expecting from the embassy but overall I was not pleased
Nice hotel. Staff was nice. Room clean and well stocked. Forgot to pack something and front desk had available no charge. There is a free shuttle from airport that runs almost 24 hours. Good food and drinks. Good location if want to eat nearby.
"Alonzo was awesome!  He really made us feel like VIP, taking us to our dinner.  He told us all the good things we needed to know about Atlanta. He made our stay at the W that much more enjoyable.  Thanks Alonzo!"
"Great stay at the Lowes! Steve, the bartender, gave such excellent service! The chicken and waffles for lunch is outstanding! Overall service in the hotel was good. Close to a lot of great restaurants. The concierge was very knowledgeable."
staff was very friendly and helpful when we checked into our room-great location with a nice view of the city-wished we could have stayed longer but we are definitely looking forward to returning soon
"Good location, superb staff! Excellent sleep quality, good coffee and of course the cookies!
Easy to find, near airport. Simple parking. Did not need to use the shuttle but it looked efficient and ran 24 hours 
Would recommend this property to anyone."
Really disappointed in this hotelÃ¢ÂÂno hot water for a shower. Was promised adjoining rooms for my family and it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt provided. The hotel valet parking was full so I had to fend for myself on parking. An unmitigated disaster for the price.
Themed after the fox theatre which is right across the street. Very convenient in midtown.  Rooms are fine. Bathroom is REALLY small.  Breakfast in restaurant was great. Staff is super friendly and helpful!
Great Hotel. Clean and Beautiful rooms. Staff was excellent. Will definitely stay with them again and again. Had a last minute trip plan and everything worked out especially being able to relax in such a wonderful hotel. Thumbs up Double Tree
"This hotel worked out great for the race and was not that far from the finish line. The room was a corner room and was nice; however, the carpet was ripped. The complimentary transportation was a bonus."
Loved the hotel.  It's smaller then other 4 star  hotels in Atl. Great location. Staff very friendly.Restaurant is OK. Only  complaint I have is that they do not have a morning newspaper available like other 4 stars in Atlanta.
We had a great experience staying at the Hyatt Midtown.  We were moving our son into his new apartment and this location was ideal.  Lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance.  Also walked to Piedmont Park.  Hotel staff was extremely friendly and accommodating!
"Great place to stay where you could sprawl out and enjoy your space. Breakfast was amazing, the omelette was the perfect touch with fresh waffles, fruit, juice, etc. close to several attractions where you can walk almost everywhere."
"For the price you pay... dinner is included, 3 alcoholic beverages are included, a great pool, great service, great room and breakfast!  Really?  It's a no brainer.  This was a great stay and we most certainly will be back."
"I stayed at this hotel, because my friend was getting married there. Hotel is located in good area. Rooms are not very clean and staff is not helpful at all. Internet was good and bar was also very nice"
"I was looking for an affordable place to stay downtown, and I have found it!  The rooms were clean and modern. The staff was very helpful, especially the gentlemen in charge of valet parking services.  There was so much to do within walking distance."
"We stay at this hotel quite frequently. We have had many group functions here include wedding receptions, baby showers, family reunions, class reunions and more. Staff was friendly and location is great."
The entire set up was wonderful. We had lunch down in the restaurant and the food and stuff were awesome. I would definitely come back and recommend both the meeting space and dining. It was easy to find and signs were easy to read.
"We're so glad you and your family enjoyed your stay with us, and the great local shopping! Thx. so much for being our guest.Please come back again, soon!"
"Amazing staff, quiet, clean and exclusive; Breakfast buffett cuisine was amazing and well managed. The view of downtown Atlanta was premium. The staff was knowledgeable, helpful and specific.  The rooms ere very quiet, clean, with many amenities."
"I enjoyed my stay and most definitely will come back. The staff was awesome!!!! I felt welcome as soon as I walked through the doors. Brandon, was an awesome shuttle driver and he recommended places to eat and see."
I love the location of this hotel and Embassy brand. This location does not meet the expectations as you receive at other Atlanta locations. Housekeeping has taken my items on two separate occasions. Any future visits are questionable.
"No Complaints. Nice clean place!  
With great access to Aquarium and CocaCola Factory. 
Also within a 5 min walk is The Atlanta Breakfast Club. Which is wonderful!  We went with 5 children and no problem."
"The room was clean, just run down. Location and parking were great though. Breakfast was decent. Damaged tub, tile, AC that barely worked, insufficient lighting in the main room. Doubt I would stay here again."
"Micheal on drive for valet and Tyler at the front desk were exceptional. The room was great- very clean, quite, comfortable and I would highly recommend Saltwood the restaurant. Great experience all the way around."
"It sounds like you need to come back and see us!  We would love to have you back for a weekend getaway, the hotel has changed quite a bit since 2006 and I think you would enjoy the enhancements.  Please come back and see us!"
"We were happy to have you as our guest, thanks so much for traveling, hope to see you again soon"
"Mid week stay to ""get away"" during a few days off.  Used as central point for day trips around Atlanta.  Chose this hotel because this brand delivers, and this location is no exception.  Staff very helpful, room met expectations.  Very comfortable, very restful."
"I booked this hotel for my friends (boyfriend) birthday. It was wayyyy more than what I expected. It had 3 levels, full kitchen, a place for me to work, and a full bedroom. The structure was the one thing that stood out at this hotel."
"Great stay, terrific room, maid service was spot on every time, breakfast was very satisfying. Felt like home didn't want to leave.  The room was clean, large enough for 1 person, free WIFI, free parking and close location to Cobb Energy Performing Arts Center."
"Clean, comfortable and quiet! Great restaurants nearby, right across the street from Northlake Mall. Several bus stops nearby on MARTA system. Plenty of space in room and work area was very functional and convenient! Great to have a full size fridge and oven in room!!"
Our sincere apologies for how we handled the Georgia Power outage. Please contact Amber Johnson so we may continue this conversation. amber.johnson3@hilton.com
"We're so glad you enjoyed your brief stay with us, and your visit to Polaris! We hope you'll come back and stay with us again (for a longer stay!)!"
"HavenÃ¢ÂÂt had a bad experience in this property, very friendly at check in, rooms clean and ready for stay. Absolutely love legal seafood. Underground valet parking is suitable. Stay on higher floors to avoid downtown noise."
Came for medical procedure.  Accommodated us on short notice- one day before.  Couldn't ask for better service.  Got in late around 8 pm.  Still had room.  Complimentary breakfast was excellent since we had a 7:30 am follow up appointment with doctor
"overnight stay, surprise!! Wonderful semi suite, kitchenette, great bathroom, shower, all for 124$
per night !!! Actuall, cannot believe the room and deal. Great location, near Buckhead, Vinnings area."
"There is always a friendly face at the front counter, clean rooms, and amazing breakfast.  I stay here frequently for business and truly feel like it is my home away from home."
"Hotel was clean, staff was friendly, complimentary breakfast was decent, made to order omelet was really good.  Convenient to Cobb Galleria.  Shuttle was prompt & drivers were very friendly & accomodating.  Great experience.  I would return."
Wonderful location to Georgia Dome and other downtown attractions! My kids loved the pool and the breakfast bar is amazing! Best waffles! The staff were very friendly at check-in and I loved the fact that I could pick my room online before arriving.
"We love Michelle the two computer working, phone answering superwoman. She makes the hotel run with happiness. Keep her at all cost.   
We have just had a great time and we owe it to her. She checked in my whole family with a smile"
From being from Atlanta I stopped here just to stay before I headed back home to the eastern shore and it was a delight here as well as all of the staff I def recommend this place to anyone 2 thumbs up
Place was nice. Service and staff great. Would stay here again next trip. They have Updated rooms and great location for galleria mall area. Shuttle will take you within a 3 mile radius and driver is awesome!
"Very nice location on the Georgia Tech campus. Made for a great jumping-off point to explore the city. We were able to check in early after an early morning flight, which was much appreciated. Friendly staff, clean room, really enjoyed our stay."
The Hyatt Perimeter at Villa Christina was a very nice hotel.  Everything was as advertised.  The beds were VERY comfortable with plenty of pillows.  The staff was very friendly and the Shuttle service was great.  We would stay again.
My stay at four seasons was great. I am grateful for the staff at the restaurant most of all. They went out their way to help me find my way around the city and went as far as to print copies of info.
"Stayed here during a conference (the conference facility was booked out), and it worked out well. The single bedroom room was recently renovated and spacious. The staff were great too- helpful and friendly. Comfortable bed, a good shower and space to relax- perfect."
"I came in to visit my daughter and stayed at the w atlanta downtown. loved it! lovely customer service. really nice people. hotel is beautiful. felt like royalty!! I go back to visit my daughter in september, guess where I will be staying. LOL."
"Great Hotel. would definitely stay again. 
Just weird way of getting into the the parking structure/valet area...looks like a delivery tunnel.  The location is very midtown so close to a lot of restaurants and easy to get where you need to go."
Large hotel with tons of amenities.  Pool nice. Close to Marta.
Had a great stay! Friendly  and very helpful staff . Asked for shuttle service several times and they were excellent! Never had to wait!  Clean room and good breakfast!  We would definitely stay again. Good job by everyone.
Shower wasnÃ¢ÂÂt very clean. White pillow had red stains. Check in staff did not explain deposit process and charges. Room was pretty small but hotel was quiet and peaceful. WiFi connection was great. I didnÃ¢ÂÂt experience any other amenities.
"Michelle is the bomb.  She is so helpful, nice, and informative. She deserves all the lord has in store for her.  I will be back in two months and canÃ¢ÂÂt wait to enjoy the Atlanta. Thank you thank you thank you"
I stayed here for a business conference and it was absolutely fabulous. The room and amenities were phenomenal! Meeting spaces were spacious and well equipped. The food was by the best I hotel food I have ever had. I would highly recommend a stay here.
We apologize for the inconvenience with your personal care products. Thank you so much for providing that information. We have shared your comments with our team. We hope you will accept our apologies and stay with us again.
Great location for the Cobb Energy Center!  Great price! Great breakfast! Staff was very friendly and helpful! Rooms were very clean and fresh. Pillows were uncomfortable but everything else was wonderful!
"Treat platinum members awesome! The breakfast and dinner options are great!! Staff very friendly! Rucha did a great job in the lounge! Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ¾Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ¾

Rooms were cool and shower water was hot! The upgrades to this hotel were needed and makes a huge difference!!"
My stay was absolutely wonderful. The entire staff  beginning at the front desk to the driver gave me the best hotel experience with a warm welcome and a delightful smile. This hotel has everything you could possibly want and need for your convenience.
"Horrible banging, beeps and all sorts of loud noise due to construction right outside our window.  No one mentioned this would be going on,  and its getting louder as I type this. Shame on you marriott."
First trip to Atlanta and will definitely come back. Felt the southern hospitality in Atlanta. The shuttle bus is an added feature which released visitors from the traffic. Thank you to the driver who provided pleasant conversation and information on area.
The room was spacious and clean. The ventilation/air conditioning system was quiet and responsive. Very modern. Great location. The staff was curious and efficient. Will always stay there when in Atlanta.
We were extremely satisfied with our stay and the Hotel Staff were very friendly and helpful in tending to our needs. Really pleased. From the moment we arrived till the day we left you could not ask for a more pleasant stay.
"We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and that our team could be of service. Glad you could enjoy the great shopping in the neighborhood, and our lobby bar! Please come back and stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead!"
It is always a pleasure to stay at the Westin Atlanta. I feel like a king whenever I visit Atlanta. The staff are friendly and professional. The cleaning staff are hard working. The location on Peachtree is ideal and everyone knows where it's at.
"Great facility and location next to the malls, SPG club has a terrific view. Rooms are the usual SPG best and I sleep great here. Always fun to see Mike T at the front desk along w the other great staff...!!"
"Clean and comfortable. Enjoyed my stay.  Housekeeping comes fairly late in the afternoon, generally more toward three, but it worked out ok most days.  They were very accommodating for my needs.  It was a pleasant stay."
"We was rather unimpressed by the hotel / room we had. Boutique but not so boutique. The room was just small, tight to be more precise......very average. The Shower had mould spots in the corners, something a little bleach would remove immediately."
"We were so glad to host you all during this year's Good Taste Series. Thx. so much for being our guest! We're so glad you enjoyed your room, and your visits to Sway and Polaris! Please come back again soon!"
I cannot express how satisfied we left from the Four Seasons. Your level of service was exceptional. Our dogs even loved the stay. They loved the pillows provided for them. Concierge was amazing and went above and beyond.
"I was greeted by an amazing front desk staff.  They helped me work out my meeting details, nap, and pool time. They were accommodating.

The room was amazing.   

Sadly I am only here for a night but this will be my go to In Atlanta."
"If you need a nice hotel near the airport this is the place for you.  The rooms are nice, the breakfast is great, and the staff is outstanding.  The location has easy access to the airport and Delta headquarters."
I was yelled at across the lobby regarding my service dog. And then lied to about complaints that it barked all night which is patently false. I felt they were acting aggressive toward me because we were an interracial couple of vast age difference
"The sales manager Nagey and her staff was  accommodating, understanding making sure everything was in place calming my staff..  The hotel is beautiful I advise any event facilitator to book your event here."
"The mix up with my room key. Hard bed, but the hotel is really nice. Food was good . Location was good. The shuttle was called complementary and appeared to be available. Room was clean but I kept itching on the sofa"
"Usually a staple of excellence but walked up to entrance with outside trash overflowing,  room dirty, and restaurant was closed due to no heat. They gave us clean room but had to repack to move. Not the normal for this chain."
"Great room with a very comfortable bed. Quiet, great amenities nearby, easily accessible walking distance to restaurants, etc. Dining room served a great breakfast buffet to fit everyone's preference."
On behalf of the hotel we apologize for the unfortunate incident with your car. You can obtain a copy of the police report by contacting the College Park Police Department at 404-761-3131.
Staff very unprofessional from professionalism to appears acting gm dressed very unprofessional and manager Eric call hisself retaliating because I contacted guest services and lied about situation no honesty and interesting lies within him would like tapes played of call and also cameras played back
"Had a great time. There were easily accessible places. We were centrally located around great restaurants, stores, and even a mall. The staff was super friendly and the rooms were kept clean. The parking was tight but overall a great experience."
This is a good place to relax and/or chill at the bar. The bar area is lively and the people engaging. The drink prices are reasonable and the table attendees are very attentive. This was our 2nd stay and we intend to stay again.
"Hotel was clean, staff was very courteous, and the food was pretty good. I chose to stay at this hotel because I had a CPE/training seminar that was held here. Excellent location and I would definitely stay here again!"
"I stay at this hotel regularly for business meetings across the street. It provides good service, friendly staff and nice,  clean rooms which are quite large.  The breakfast buffet is good and reasonable. I would recommend this hotel."
Rooms are not very modern but everything was clean and nice.  Hotel staff was amazing. Great customer service.
"While it was noticeable that the carpet and pads were new, everything else was just ok. Because we scheduled many rooms, the price was higher than advertised on the web page. Three days for $500 is more than some other nicer places we have stayed."
"As always Embassy Suites delivers!
I've stayed in numerous Embassy Suites over the years. I am always treated like a queen. The food is good the staff is great and they aim to please. If you want a great experience, Go!"
"What great comments!  I'm so glad you were pleased with the hotel and service.  Sounds like you were very busy with the production this past trip, I hope you have a bit more free time on your next visit to relax!"
"The staff is horrible and the general manager needs to learn to cater to the guest!  I stayed at this hotel and had the worst stay of my hotel life!!!  If you have choices, make another.  Do not stay at this location."
Overall I had a great stay at the Westin. I found the staff and the accommodations to be top notch. The only issue that I had was with the wireless. It was extremely slow and I defaulted to my cell phone as a hot spot.
"Stayed at this location one evening for work.  I had a conference at the mart.  It was a perfect location, I was able to leave my car, just a walk across the street.  The staff was friendly and professional.  Great amenities! Clean and comfy!"
"While checking in at the Marriott Atlanta Northwest Galleria, Yasmine was VERY helpful! Her customer service was exceptional. :) She was very accommodating and nice. I will recommend anyone traveling here to ask for her!"
"Great location and staff, rooms were very uncomfortable. I switch my room thinking it was just that one and no. Both rooms were moist, the sheets were damped. But the property overall was nice. Just need better room maintenance. 

- A hotel manager. Ã°ÂÂÂ"
My experience here was poor from the staff to the room quality. This hotel is not up to the usual quality I find with DoubleTree branded hotels. I would not recommend choosing this hotel with other options in the area.
Great atmosphere in a Bar.  Fantastic corner room very comfortablle and good views.  Also Got an upgrade on arrival.  Pool a bit shallow (4 feet) but could swim ok.  Concierge helpful.  People in Atlanta very friendly.
"Unexpected stay because of family medical emergency made much less stressful because of the kind and caring staff at this hotel. The convenient location, free parking and shuttle plus a wonderful breakfast each day was terrific!"
We all loved the spacious rooms the Embassy always has to offer. The evening reception seemed to be a hit and itÃ¢ÂÂs very great that they do this every night (I believe). We slept very well here and enjoyed the stay. Good location as well.
"I was here for work and this hotel was great!  The staff was wonderful, friendly, and just great to be around. I'm hoping to come to Atlanta for an actual vacation and would stay here again!  The gym was nice and the food was great!"
"My wife and I stayed here one night while we were in the area for an appt.   will definitely use this hotel again; staff and service was excellent!  Very clean facility, within walking distance to the SunTrust stadium (new Braves stadium)"
"This property is a bit dated and tired, but staff were friendly and it offered good value for our overnight stay before an early departure from Atlanta Airport.
Shuttle runs from 4:00 AM and the drivers were very, very friendly and courteous."
"Courteous, friendly and helpful staff. Spacious clean room. Good connectivity to accommodate multiple devices. Quality food and willing to be flexible to accommodate special dietary needs. Good common areas for gathering."
We arrived late at night and had no issues checking in or even getting food at the restaurant.  The waitress was wonderful and even recommended a few sights to see.  Staff was very attentive to our needs and responded quickly with special requests.
"Great hotel at a decent price!!
Nice rooms, clean, very friendly service!
ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot to do in Midtown and great restaurants within walking distance of Loews. Will definitely be back when traveling through!"
My wife and I were very impressed with the cleanliness of our room.  The host did an excellent job in checking us into our room.  Great stay!
"The Hyatt Place was only two blocks from the conference hotel, had a nice room with a better rate and included a pretty good breakfast.  It was a great find.  I like this chain and signed up for their loyalty program."
Such a historic place and fun vibe.  Every single employee greeted us with a smile.  Modern touches but it still has historic charm.  Great courtyard and bar area.  We we able to walk to several places so we didn't even need our car.
Our waitress at the hotel's restaurant was absolutely amazing! We were granted passes for breakfast per concierge & she made certain that we were well compensated for the mishaps. Her sister is pretty dope too - they're both true Ethiopian beauties Ã°ÂÂÂ
"Nice clean hotel and room. Pool, gym, Wi-Fi looked great even though I didn't use them as my stay was one night only. Very friendly staff always smiling and trying to please the customer. Bring extra cash for breakfast or plan to eat elsewhere."
"Come here with the family for a conference, the hotel is at a great location and hotel looks great.  Room is good and clean, overlooking the pool.  Not inexpensive but fair value for an excellent hotel stay."
The four Seasons in Atlanta has great service and great accommodations.  The location is central to the city so everything is 15 minutes away or less.  we love the bar and feel the bartenders are the best in the city.
The Ellis is a great hotel in the center of town.  The staff is excellent from the front desk to the bar tender to the dining room staff to the bell staff to the valet.  Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.
Rooms were clean. All employees were friendly. The Housekeepers were always smiling and greeting us.
Newly renovated rooms were very clean and comfortable. Had balcony suite overlooking the atrium on top floor. Staff was friendly and professional. A good breakfast was served each day. As always the cookies were delicious.
"Had a great breakfast. Rooms were clean but carpet looked old, smelled slightly like old smoke. other than that it was perfect, smell wasnÃ¢ÂÂt overwhelming and well worth the money. Full clean kitchen with all necessities."
"My wife and I was very pleased with staff and the hotel was the best ever.. Can't find staff like that any more... if you looking for a good hotel with great staff, this place is great, clean room 100%"
"I have have stayed at this hotel on 3 separate occasions and by far, this was the best. The only downside is the outside traffic noise but that cannot be helped. Staff were friendly and accommodating and the room was amazing!"
Great property but undergoing some renovation. Sometimes noisy in the morning. I will recommend calling before booking your reservation. The rooms were clean and staff was very friendly. The location was good.
"Thx. so much for your review. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and our views of the city! Please come back and stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead!"
This hotel is fairly new and has a great location in Midtown.  It was easily walkable to many restaurants and bars as well as the (wonderful) Piedmont Park.  Price was pretty good too.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Clean too.
Love the Doubletree. Great location. Great room and stay.  Didn't stay long enough to experience the restaurant or room-in. Parking situation was good once explained. Staff was great. Definitely recommend.
"There was an issue with my booking.  However, the staff worked very hard to accommodate my needs.  I was understanding and patient with them and because of my patience, they made my stay very pleasurable and welcoming.  It all worked out perfectly!"
"Everyone I encountered during this stay was unfailingly pleasant, friendly and helpful.  The facilities were spotless.   There is shopping and eateries within close walking distance.  The area is beautiful. I would recommend this hotel to everyone!"
"Went for a concert at State Farm Arena. Very convenient! Many dining options including CNN food court. Great to get Starbucks in the morning. This hotel is also close to Atlanta attractions: Coca Cola Factory, Aquarium, Civil Rights Museum, College Football Hall of Fame."
I stayed for only one night on a business trip.  The hotel is well priced for the Buckhead are.  The rooms were clean.  The air conditioning was excellent.  Uber was easily accessed from the hotel.  The complimentary buffet breakfast was in an attractive spacious room
"We've stayed in a double queen suite for our last 3 visits over the past 4 months. The hotel is clean, bright, and modern. The complimentary breakfast has a large selection and is very tasty. The staff is beyond friendly and helpful!!"
It was a great hotel. Breakfast was good. The hotel was in a good location close to a lot of shopping and restaurants. Also only about 10 minutes from downtown.  Would definitely stay there again when in the area.
"This hotel is in need of serious updating. There had been water damage - badly repaired- rooms not
clean- not vacuumed- plugs in sinks were not even hooked up. Not the most pleasant stay. 
Desk help at times- not the friendliest"
"Comfortable rooms and close to the airport. Excellent staff, particularly Alicia in the dining room. She has an outstanding attitude and provides superior service. She should be your next hotel manager!!!"
"The staff of this hotel was extremely accommodating,  friendly, and considerate.  The food was delicious and the restaurant menu was very reasonable. 
The property was warm and comfortable.
Transportation to the site was convenient using public means."
"Nice room, with fridge, microwave & coffee maker.  Even though I was on the first floor, the room was quiet - with a separate door to bedroom from outer room.  Great place to stay if with family.  Will stay there again."
"Hotel is right in the middle of everything! Only had to drive to get to Fernbank and the zoo. First room had a few ants crawling around, but they moved and accommodated us. Parking lot was always full!"
"Parking too expensive, location great, friendly staff. Dfghu jgfyuj bgujgfu jjfdxvnji hfdfghgv hi yggji gfchhfft (55(((J.

"The facilities, front line, and service staff were all professional and welcoming.  The location was perfect for the downtown event.  Staff knew the local food and entertainment venues.  Overall great experience"
Was there during Pride weekend. The location was perfect for all LGBT areas. The value was great for the neighborhood (other hotels were very pricey for that weekend). The decor is a little bit outdated. The bed was very comfortable though.
"Hotel shuttle will take you anywhere within 3 miles, which means just about everything downtown or the city center.  Room was clean and confortable, as were the common areas.  Staff was friendly.  We would stay again."
Check in was very quick and easy.  Although large hotel the elevators came quickly.  The room was average and the beds afforded a restful nights sleep.  Parking was a slightly inconvenient and probably worth utilizing valet.  Would stay here again.
"My wife and 4 y/o son were trapped in the elevator for 30-45 min as it went up and down uncontrollably, stopping and shaking.  Ã¢ÂÂEmergency Ã¢ÂÂ phone had busy tone! No one responded to alarm! My son in tears"
Atlanta visit was great and hotel overall was satisfying. The breakfast was good. The wine coolers were very expensive at $6.00 each. Great location and easy to find and it was close to lots of great restaurants.
"I totally LOVE the Hotel!! It is beautiful and their staff is awesome, Turnhan the front desk associate was the best so accommodating and friendly, Very professional! I will definitely recommend and return for another stay!"
We had a wonderful stay at Artmore Hotel in Atlanta. The deluxe suite suited are needs perfectly. The location was perfect. The help there was wonderful. We visited a few sites not far from the hotel. We had a very nice stay.
"Staff very accomodating and courteous . Rooms were clean roomy and comfortable with nice decor, great shuffle service and the hotel in excellent location"
Invaluable shuttle service to pickup dins; relax on chaise (thank YOU) and great hot break - made for a great day 1 of 6 travel days to drive back home to Canada.  Thak YOU  Please don't change what is working!
"The hotel was nice, room was clean and comfortable. Loved the coffee.Enjoyed my stay. I was there for a business conference. The conference room was great. The food in the hotel was excellent. I really liked the pleasant staff."
"We truly appreciate your comments and are glad to hear that you found our hotel to be a great unique venue.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thanks"
"I had a wonderful time and found rest in this relaxing hotel.
Staff was very friendly. Room was clean and beautiful!
Great for couples weekend. Downtown Location.
I will book this hotel again whenever I need some ""me"" Time"
Stayed for 3 nights to visit Atlanta.  Pleasant experience in a spacious 2 bedroom suite. Used it as home base to watch some baseball and visit local attractions.  Staff was friendly and courteous. Breakfast was what you would expect. Accommodations were ideal for our family.
The Hyatt is an easy walk to restaurants and bars in Midtown Atlanta. The hotel provided excellent service and wonderful accomodations.  The staff was friendly and did everything they could to make our stay relaxed and comfortable.  We would definitely stay here again.
"Tasha Williams was absolutely the nicest and most helpful room attendant I've encountered. She pointed out all the services and areas of interest during our business trip.

She even offered to talk to someone about the pool temperature.

Respectfully 

Matt"
"Great location for a Braves game. New hotel, nicely appointed. Worst luxury hotel experience ever for a $700 night stay. From check-in to check-out, a series of hotel management and service miscues that absolutely ruined a nice over-night stay for a game."
"Great hotel in a convenient area. The staff are its main asset-all were unfailingly helpful and friendly. The room was a good size and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast was a generous and impressive buffet. Recommended, especially for the price. Lovely people!"
"Perfect location to stay in when going to see a baseball game at Suntrust Field.  Quite expensive for the night we were there, and felt like the room was a little sparse (not many amenities included).  The Battery area is spectacular."
We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Thx. so much for your comments. Please stay with us again the next time you're in Buckhead!
"This is my second stay at this hotel.  I will definitely return.  It is central located, near the Aquarium, the Coca-Cola museum, CNN, and Centennial Park.  The rooms are spacious.  They offer free breakfast, and happy hour each evening."
I have personally reached out via email.
"The check-in was smooth and easy, clean lobby, clean room, and friendly staff. I would stay here again. I wish I would have been prepared because I wanted to get into the pool spa. The complimentary breakfast was great."
"Great location for Suntrust/ Braves stadium. Short walk and let us park a few hours before check- in to go to the game. Valet staff very prompt and courteous.  Room was clean and comfortable. And, great cookies at the front desk!"
Great location to all attractions. You can walk to everything within 10 minutes or less. Plenty of places to eat and in walking distance from hotel.  Very clean and well kept up. Front desk staff is very helpful and very polite.
The hotel staff were the most helpful from check in. Check and fast and seamless. There was a small issue with room but was immediately rectified. The rooms were clean and always fresh. The restaurants and deli conveniently located.
"The room was very comfortable and quiet.
Plenty of HBOs. Great shower. 
Free afternoon drinks and free breakfast.
The front desk was polite and helpful as were the wait people in the restaurant. 
Nice view too"
Your compliments are very much appreciated. Our team works hard to make sure guests like you are comfortable and have a memorable experience. We enjoy showing off our great property and are looking forward to your return.
The front desk folks were great and very helpful.  The room was nicer than most with good amenities and a nice bar downstairs in the lobby.  The location is perfect for folks traveling to the arena and attraction areas.
Front desk clerk was a bit short and seemed rather upset with us when we attempted to check out using a groupon discount. Room 811 is subject to elevator noise and not a recommend room to try to sleep in.
"This hotel is located in the heart of downtown Atlanta. It's quite and relaxing. The spa and Gym at the facility are terrific for Atlanta.
It's close to the airport with so many restaurants within walking distance."
"Exceptional customer service; clean, comfy, beautiful rooms; quality hot breakfast & evening appetizers. Stayed here with a group for a business meeting. Meeting room was excellent, staff was very helpful."
"The hotel was great. The location was outside the main city, so it was great to not having to deal with a lot of traffic. The cookies were very good. The staff was nice and excited to make our stay one of the best."
The changing of linen policy is ridiculous. This is how most hotel ratings go down. The towels are stained. Just not pleased at all. I will not recommend this hotel for anyone to stay at this hotel. S
The hotel was very nice and the people were very hospitable and welcoming. It costs $40 to valet park on the premises and 20 at the garage down the road if you get there in time so be very prepared for a short walk!
Our room had some unknown substances smeared on the walls. All of the wallpaper was discolored or dirty. The room was terrible. The actual hotel was beautiful though!  The lobby and waterfall were amazing and the staff was really nice. We just hated the room.
"Beautiful accommodations and wonderful service! I never wanted to leave the room. The views on 14th floor were fab, especially from the tub. I haven't stayed anywhere like the MO in Atlanta and will try to get back there soon!"
"We were in town for a convention booking was made by an agent so didn't know what to expect. No complaints here comfortable beds, great staff, fitness room is AWESOME and so is the pool. Conveniently located close to some great restaurants"
We would like to thank you for such a good review of our hotel the Embassy Suites Hotel Atlanta Airport . We also hope to be seeing you again soon.
"When we are in Atlanta we find this hotel to be one of the best we've stayed in. Clean, secure, convenient to down town, with the staff very helpful and polite.
They don't come any better for a hotel like this."
Average hotel with great location and room rate. I would suggest staying here but the hotel had no free parking and that increased the cost  by $18 a day.
"Combined a convention, and an extended weekend stay in Atlanta. Great rates, nice room, and good selection of breakfast items. Location is convenient to many great restaurants, shopping, MARTA, grocery store just through the parking lot."
"We were here with family and super pleased by the amazing service and the team at this location. Would definitely stay again. The boiled eggs needed to be rinsed at breakfast, otherwise fantastic!!!!!"
"We always choose this hotel when in the Atlanta area.  Staff is the best.  They greet everyone with a smile.  This is the location for fast, friendly, and family environment.  Food is really good.  Will return soon"
"Everything was very clean, the people at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. My partner and I are not ""normal"" looking and they treated us exactly the same as the ""normal"" looking people. I will stay here again!"
Love this hotel!  Our room was incredible with an amazing view of the city.  All of the staff were extremely attentive and professional.  Guido at The Livingston made sure that we had a fabulous meal!  Can't wait to stay again!
Typical great Homewood accomodations with unique 2 story separate buildings separated by gardens.  Located conveniently on I75 and I285 with shopping galore close by and many restaurants within easy walking distance.
"Thx. so much for your review. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and our rooftop Polaris restaurant. Please come back soon!"
"First impressions are most important and Lance and Nick at reception, made the very best.  5 stars!  
They were welcoming, charming and funny--made the end of a grueling travel day unexpectedly great. Never enjoyed scratch-offs so much!"
check in and check out was great. the young lady who checked me in and out was very hospitable and attentive.  the room was clean and neat and the room service was excellent. i will definitely be returning to this location.
This is by far the best hotel experience I have had thus far.  I travel often and this is the best hotel in Atlanta.  The service was top notch and the room was unbelievable.  I will definitely stay at the Mandarin Oriental many times over.
"Thx. so much for your comments, and for being our guest. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and our great downtown neighborhood. Please come back and stay with us again, soon!"
Hotel was in a great location and we enjoyed our small walks. The breakfast was good and the staff was friendly and kind. The rooms were quiet and we really enjoyed our three night stay. Great getaway!
"Located close by to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport this is our ""go-to"" place when traveling out of town. In addition to the convenient location, the expert staff continues its fine tradition of efficiency. The rooms are clean, spacious, and comfortable."
"Great hotel and easy access to the interstate. Our room was very clean, but could use some more pictures on the walls and the complimentary breakfast was very good. The front desk clerk was very friendly and professional. The hotel is beautiful inside and out."
"Can not say enough about this hotel. I have stayed here 20+ times for business over the years and it's my favorite place to stay. Rooms are very nice and well appointed. Staff is always pleasant and helpful. Never a bad stay, highly recommend."
"I would return here more because of the staff and their attentiveness and friendliness. The first room we received wasn't as nice as I expected, but they moved us quickly to another that met most of my expectations."
"twoman04,

I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay at the Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta. We hope you decide to return for another visit soon.

"5 stars - Comfortable, friendly, clean, safe, professional. The Comfort Inn on Circle Drive provided us with outstanding service, in a clean and comfortable setting. The staff is professional and attentive.  Plus the daily cookies are always warm and inviting whenever you come in."
"Please make sure that Ebony knows how much I appreciate her professionalism. As a Divisional Director and if my staff was as professional and courteous as Ebony, it would be great. Hyatt has found a gem in Ebony."
This was possibly my worst hotel stay ever!! Renovations were underway and no one said anything about it. The staff acting like they were oblivious to the noise from construction and the dirty rooms. Poor stay!
"Held a large event at this property and it was perfect. The hotel itself has a classy aesthetic, with a great amount of amenities and dining options on site (in addition to the nice rooms). One of the better hotel experiences I have ever had."
Nice  Location not too far from places to shop in great places to eat. Great job on the remodel. Friendly and what welcoming.  We use this hotel me travel there for business and stay every year. Nice place.
The Hyatt Regency perimeter hotel was top notch once again. This was our second stay and continued to impress. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are spotless. The bathrooms have a lot room and provide ease-of-use and are spotless.
"I stayed at this hotel last month and I was shockingly amazed.   The rooms are gorgeous.  Its like staying in a studio apartment.  Near attractions downtown like Centennial Park.  
This has to be one of the best hotels in the downtown area of Atlanta."
"My family group of 6 booked 3 rooms for 2 nights. We really enjoyed our stay at this airport hotel. Room was spacious and breakfast was awesome. Rhea, the hotel manager, was very helpful when we switched credit cards for payments."
"Charged my card for two nights room charges for a pre-paid stay and will not return my calls. My only option is to dispute the charge with my credit
 card. Heard a similar story from the person next to me at the checkout desk."
The suite was spacious and clean.  The attendants at the desk were helpful and gave my wife a number code so she could use her laptop in the lobby plus 3 comp. breakfast buffets.  Great place and convenient too.
"We found the rooms to be just average, with a few nasty stains. The pool area, however, is very nice, and there is a starbux off the pool area. The location is convenient to downtown and the attractions"
"Excellent accommodation's! On problem hotel had ""Direct TV which I don't like because we could not watch the sports programs that we wanted to watch like NFL football and NBA basketball. that sucked!!!!"
"This was the host hotel for a conference I was attending. I was very happy with my accommodations, the food, the options within the hotel, and the closeness to downtown spots. The customer service was consistently helpful and pleasant."
We are glad you enjoyed our renovations and that you had a mostly good stay. We look forward to seeing you again on your next trip our way. Thank you.
nice except for the lobby lounge. The remodel has killed the ambiance. I am concerned they are only chasing the business conference dollar and not concerned about the casual weekend traveler. Lighting is way too bright!
"We truly appreciate your comments and are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us while attending the concert at Center Stage.  We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thanks"
Perfect set up for extended stays. I came from Canada for 1+ week to have surgery and was very comfortable.  We brought our dog and had no issues. Staff were wonderful. There isn't much within walking distance but they do have a free shuttle.
"I have overnighted here several times while passing through Atlanta.  This latest visit did not disappoint.  Rooms clean, bed comfortable.  The in house restaurant is convenient and food was good.  Hotel staff and restaurant staff were friendly and helpful.  All in all a good stay!"
"first time there and I'll definitely go back.  everything was very nice,  Big clean rooms    (I booked three for the team) easy in and out, friendly staff.  B'fast was a bit weak but it was ok.  Didn't expect to pay to park, but oh well."
"I had a good time at this hotel. The service was great and the facilities were solid. The best part was Paul, the shuttle driver. I believe it is the little things that set hotels apart and Paul provided such a wonderful experience."
"Excited you had a beautiful experience, come back soon"
"Atlanta Marriott Buckhead Hotel & Conference Center is perfect for business, leisure or even a combination of both! We are so glad you enjoyed your suite accommodations as well as our convenient location and services.  We hope to see you again soon."
"This hotel is a great location to the aquarium and coke museum. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. They also have two pools, indoor and outdoor. We had no complaints. it was a nice stay. Staff very nice"
"Poor management, unclean room, unprofessional staff.  Wasn't given the room advertised to me.  Manager never returned my call in to him.  Housekeeping refused to give towels upon request.  I will send a letter to Wyndham to outline my concerns."
Got a special on priceline for $70 a night.  Great location.  Rooms are updated.  The building is historic so the bathrooms are small. Hotel staff was friendly.  Near the theater.  Walked to a couple great restaurants. I would stay again.
-Great service and nice room. The hotel is within walking distance to our conference venue and TedÃ¢ÂÂs restaurant. The hotel restaurant also had good food and service. The front desk folks are nice and helpful.  It  was a great stay for our confe
Welcome back home!
The hotel was close to venue we attended.  The staff were always nice and helpful.  The facility was clean and it had a small store which was quite convenient for us.  I would definitely stay there for another weekend getaway.
"easy checkin - easy checkout. friendly staff makes the stay pleasant.  the shuttle to the airport is easy, every half hour makes it easy to schedule,  with super nice driver!! will come back to stay there again."
"The hotel is newish, and the rooms are nice.  The restaurant was great, especially the outside dining.  Not only was the food good,  the outside dining area was beautiful, and the service was great!  The staff was awesome!"
"The Wyndham Galleria is a wonderful hotel. With plenty of amenities nearby within walking distance like CVS, a Publix, and a Starbucks. I would like to thank Rosemary and all the staff at the Chattahoochee Grill for their excellent service."
"I felt like the fact that the hotel perfectly blended with the outdoors. It was a very relaxing environment tucked away in the woods, but footsteps from restaurants, shopping, Emory University and the CDC. The staff was so friendly, every step of the way."
"The room was adequate. The room needed some touch up paint. Felt a bit worn. I also thought for the rate, a better offering of coffee would have been nice. The staff was helpful and friendly. The overnight valet of $30 seemed a bit steep."
"I have stayed here many times over the last 15 years or so, and I won't stay anywhere else when visiting Atlanta for business or pleasure. The rooms are spacious, the grounds are beautiful and the staff outstanding."
The Intercontinental Buckhead is a great place to stay. It is not what I would consider to be a true 5 star experience but overall was very nice. The staff was always ready to help and the rooms were nice.
Stayed here for a family reunion.  The place is very clean and the hotel was great in providing a welcoming experience.  I would definitely stay here again the next time I. Atlanta.  Great location near restaurants and shopping.
"I travel to Atlanta frequently and I stay at the ECCH every time.  The people is what makes me come back over and over again.  In addition, the accommodations are very comfortable, the location is convenient, and the setting is gorgeous."
Spent one night to be close to local nightclub.  Really nice hotel and busy since they had a convention happening.  Wished the price could have been lower.
"I stayed at the Embassy Suites Airport in Atlanta GA., recently on a trip there for a convention.  I was very satisfied with the accomidations.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone that needs to go to Atlanta GA."
We stayed here upon visiting Georgia Tech with our son who's a junior in high school. Our arrival was late but the staff and valet parking were fantastic!  All so polite and helpful! Loved this hotel and would suggest it to everyone traveling in Atlanta!
understaffed in many areas of service (check-in reception & pool) .  Views of the battery and breakfast/service was excellent!  Has potential to be great but has a long way to go to be seen as a 5 star hotel.
The location and the customer service is exceptional at this hotel. Parking is a little steep at $30.  Didn't eat at the hotel just coffee on the way out each morning and grab a cookie in the afternoon.  I love the digital key. :-)
"No words to express how enjoyable my stay was . The hotel was very clean, the bathroom was awesome!! I would stay nowhere else when visiting Atlanta. Absolutely stunning and considered staying an extra night."
"I've stayed at this Westin multiple times and I always have a pleasant experience. The staff are very helpful and attentive, fulfilling requests promptly and with a smile. The rooms are clean and the gym has good equipment. I can't wait to be back!"
"The Shuttle service was awesome as well as the staff, breakfast and rooms. The shuttle service dropped us off at the Mercedes Stadium before the game and picked us up afterwards. walking distance to all the downtown attractions. Will stay again."
We picked this hotel since it was an easy walk to the Marta train and easy walk to Georgia Tech for a football game. Hotel was clean and the breakfast was fresh and constantly well stocked. Looking forward to coming back to Atlanta!
"Spent a weekend here with my boys (7 and 10) in August.  Great location -- only about 15 min to the center of town, plus a number of decent restaurants within walking distance.  Indoor pool was great.  Would definitely stay here again!"
Great location for business and having multiple dining and shopping options. The area is safe to enjoy the outdoors for a walk and the restaurants are within blocks of the hotel. Easy access to the highway for business and the airport.
"Staff was friendly,  only complaint would be with valet. Only seemed to be one person parking cars, unloading bags and helping guests to their rooms. The bathroom door was off track, but it was quickly corrected.  Everything else was great."
"Absolutely greatest experience of my life. Great food, fantastic staff, highly recommended. I will definitely be come back for more fun sometime soon. Truly blessed, and very thankful. #preciousmemories"
"We're so glad you and your family enjoyed your stay with us. So glad we could be of service! Hope you guys will come back and stay with us again, soon!"
I really enjoyed this hotel it was a wonderful experience the staff was very friendly the rooms are very clean and impressive my wife and I celebrated our 2 year anniversary we enjoyed every moment of it!
No breakfast or parking included in rate. I paid more for parking while a guest at this hotel than it cost to park to go to the airport. I have parked here to travel in the past and paid less per day.
"Nice location, great atmosphere, overall good customer service and nice view of ATL. Check in lines are slow and construction is going on at the property but other than that my experience was great - no complaints."
Great location.  You can walk to everything in the Battery and never need your car.  Nice hotel and friendly staff.  Reasonably priced for hotels in the area and a much nicer experience.  I would highly recommend
"4 pm late checkout for our valued SPG members? You got it. 
A rooftop lounge with views of the Atlanta skyline? Absolutely, Whiskey Blue. 
In-house gastro-pub with *delicious* ricotta flat bread?  Cook Hall, at your service.  
This is what W is all about."
"The rooms were beautiful, however, the hotel was hot, it flooded, no hot water in the bathroom, no free continental breakfast and was told there was by the front desk clerk.  Very impersonal, not a warm welcome.  NOTHING but attitude."
"Nice, comfortable clean place to stay. The staff has lost their ""southern comfort"". So not very nice people. But over look that it was a great stay! I would stay again just because everything else was great!"
"This hotel is conveniently located. The air units in the room were a bit loud and not working efficiently, but the rooms are very clean. The check in process is very easy. There are a few good restaurants in the area and good shopping."
"A great hotel, the suite was large and roomy. The only glitch was the elevators were twitchy, at times they  did not want to work without help from front desk. Funny the first time, annoying the second and third."
We enjoyed our weekend in the city at the Westin. The staff was very accommodating and went above and beyond for our anniversary. We had beautiful view of the city from our room and the room its self was spacious and extremely clean.
"Stayed at the hotel for a couple of days for a conference, the quality of rooms was great, the food in restaurant and conference facilities was good. My room was very comfortable and spacious. The staff were friendly and professional."
He is the hottest guy in town. He was awesome and provided us with great services. He greeted us from the time we stepped in the door. I love his sense of humor and the rapport he builds with the consumers.
House keeping took my clothes and I havent gotten it back yet. Staffing too arrogant to respond. I contacted the front desk with no success.i gave up after certain time as i had to leave early morning
Staff at this hotel is excellent. I've traveled and stayed in hotels for 19 years now and this is one of the best places I've ever stayed. The staff  are genuinely friendly and helpful. I will most definitely stay here again when in Atlanta!
"A nice place to stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel is in a great location; walking distance to just about everything you may want or need. The pool is nice, just wished it was an indoor pool."
"It's what you would expect from Indigo and more. Great rooms (the view!), great service, super central location. I loved the big windows and the modern feel. And the Hard Rock Cafe on the other side of the street :)"
Staff was courteous and friendly. Always willing to help. Nice room for good price. Pool is heated and very clean. Room service was great. Menu choices/price were good. BBQ chicken flatbread was awesome!
The hotel is centrally located to a number of downtown attractions and is in a cool old building.  Also with a view of the new Falcons football stadium.  A very helpful and friendly staff.  The dining area was unique and the breakfast was very good.
"Check in was slow. Room was ok. Decent breakfast. I never expect much from hotels located near an airport. Just a place to sleep. Nice bath towels and an area to work on your computer. 
Bed was comfortable"
The hotel was very nice. We stayed in a double bed room! Very nice sized room. The breakfast was good. They had a nice selection of items to choose from. The hotel staff were very nice and professional.
"For being in the middle of activity, this hotel was extremely reasonable.  They have a bar, restaurant, gym and a restaurant.  What more do you need when traveling?  And if you do want to venture out, you are surrounded by so many options to eat."
Came to Atlanta to visit family and some site seeing.  Great location being close to airport and easy to drive into town or south to see family.  Staff was very friendly and strived to provide a positive stay.
"have stayed here before for the location, within walking distance to aquarium, football, basketball, etc.  restaurant behind is feed and reasonable gamex in front for kids.  overall. eat location in area just disappointed in restaurant costs on site"
"Very Average... Great location but old hotel with old fixtures and nasty carpet.  closed in lobby low ceilings from the 70's, but prices in line with the very nice hotels in the same neighborhood.  Shame I went with brand loyalty and got burned"
"This hotel was in great shape with well appointed clean comfortable rooms. The staff was first class, professional, well informed and friendly! I will definitely stay here again on business in the future."
"We came back to relax and get away for Valentines Day. It was nice and quiet. Most of all, it was cozy and a short drive to everything such as the UBar Atl and downtown. The staff was vert friendly and helpful."
Have stayed here on a number of occasions when down visiting for business. Perfect location and easy to get to off of the 75. Always leave here very pleased with the room and service. They have a very good breakfast as well. Great hotel.
"They used the bate and switch game.  The confirmed my reservations, then overbooked and gave our room away.  We had to settle for something other than what was booked and confirmed by them less than 24 hours of our arrival."
The Ellis Hotel is a beautiful place to stay and is easy access to dining and the Convention Center. The rooms were very nice and the staff was accommodating. I would stay here again if I come back to Atlanta.
"My room wasn't clean, and Housekeeping offered to clean at 5:30pm - I was checking out the next day so I declined.  Also the sink in the bathroom leaked all over the basin.  I was very surprised by this."
"I was immediately turned off by the charge for guests to pay for parking. However,  the FREE happy hour and FULL breakfast completely made me forget about paid parking. Every staff member I encountered was professional and courteous."
"The suites and gathering areas were much larger and nicer than expected.  The staff are friendly and courteous.  The complimentry breakfast and dinner was good, and available for a couple of hours.  I will definetly stay again on my next business trip."
The staff at this location are very professional and courteous. The selection of food at the manager's reception was very good. The hotel is also in a very good location.  I would recommend this hotel to any business traveler.
"When I purchased the room they informed me that price was 211, when I checkout the price was 330.00 double taxed my reservation. Items was missing out of the room that I had to call for service to have replaced"
I was pleasantly vested greeted by this fantastic staff. My room was not only what i expected but the service was nothing less than A1. Leading the charge was this smacking young woman Amaya. Thank you
This is a nice Wingate property. Employees were all very friendly and professional! Rooms were clean and comfortable!
Attractive and comfortable boutique hotel in great location with friendly efficient staff. Well worth a visit. Atlanta is a very attractive and vibrant city boasting traditional Southern hospitality and the Hotel Indigo Midtown is a true reflection of the city.
"Larry, we are so very sorry your customer service experience was not up to our standards. We have let our team know. Please also feel free to reach out to us at qualityaltra@hyatt.com to contact a manager about your stay. Please accept our apologies."
It's obvious this is an older hotel but Hyatt has done a pretty good job of renovating and modernizing the place.  Staff is extremely pleasant and accommodating. Breakfast offering and 24/7 menu are very nice. Location is fantastic.
Loved the location of this hotel.  The skybridge to the Marriott and access to food court/mall was priceless!!  The staff was friendly and everyone spoke no matter where I was in the hotel.  Breakfast buftet in Sway was remarkable!
I chose this hotel because it is were the business conference I was attending was located.  Plenty of places to eat and a movie theatre within walking distance.  Everything was clean and well maintained.  Would definitely stay here again.
Decent hotel and great value!  Absolutely worth the price...I would actually give 3-1/2 stars.  If the rate would be much higher than $150 or so I would not think it was great value.  Staff inside hotel is friendly and likable.
"We truly appreciate your comments and are happy to hear that you enjoyed staying with us. We look forward to having you stay with us again soon.

Thanks"
"Under construction. Many accommodation perks unavailable during construction such as typical medical supplies for purchase ie, Tylenol, aspirin, deodorant, mouthwash, toothpaste. Staff was A+ service. No one available to assist taking luggage to room. Loud drilling during weekend sleep hours."
"The hotel rooms are spacious, quiet, and easy to work in. Other amenities are adequate but more expensive than they need to be. Nothing blatantly terrible, but nothing blatantly wonderful either. Food is good, they have Guinness in cans. Fitness center is being remodeled."
Rooms are small due to round shape of the hotel.  The elevators can be heard in your room and if your high up it can take 5 min to get down.  The sidewalk has a homeless problem and they are very aggressive
"Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  Especially Marsha, the guest check in staff member.  Super clean room.  Quiet and comfortable.  Breakfast was amazing!  Looking forward to our next visit to a Crowne Plaza!"
"I was concerned about the cleanliness of this hotel after reading reviews, but our room was very clean and service was great. The staff was friendly and helpful.  The conference chairs were more comfortable than most. Overall a good experience."
"Lisa waited on us (a group of 5) for dinner - great service!  As our group grew to 20+, the service never faltered. Lisa's friendly, knowledgeable, entertaining, and the food was delicious (order the charcuterie)."
"The price for what we receive is really good, but the upkeep of the property, especially the outdoors of each of the buildings, needs better upkeep. Often they are dirty or in slight disrepair. The employees are really nice & the free breakfast is good."
"Very clean rooms,  nice staff and very convenient to Mercedes Benz Stadium.  Ruth Chris's Steakhouse is awesome.  The rooms are really large, lots of space, and havve  2 tv's, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. We will definitely be back!Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â"
Very nice hotel. It has parking and free airport shuttles to and from the airport. Parking is cheaper than the airport parking and they do all the luggage handling . I will use this place again. Only hotel located on the airport property
Valet lost my car keys. Wasted day. Hotel comped my valet fee. I was not going to pay it anyway. Ruined sat am since no car. Could have come in a day later. Clearly should have removed that days room fee
Overall the hotel was good because of its location. During the time that I stayed the staff seemed overwhelmed and was therefore short with my family. During breakfast they ran out of bowls and cups for coffee.
We booked two rooms and a suite for a family wedding.  The cost was very reasonable and the hotel was clean.   The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were spacious. Breakfast was extra and room service was available only after 5pm.
"We chose this location based on its convenient location to the interstate. The hotel needs a complete renovation because the dated decor, furniture, lighting, and poor quality of the air conditioner failed to provide the relaxation needed for our travels."
"Familywandering, we apologize for the noise issues experienced. Our engineering team is looking into your concerns to ensure this was an isolated issue.

We hope to have the opportunity to serve you again during your next visit to Atlanta!"
My husband and I typically reside at the ICB when we travel to ATL.Stayed here for our anniversary&were very pleased. Hotel staff was amazing & overall the hotel was very clean. We would stay here again!
"Beautiful hotel, reasonably priced, near Marta public transportation. Has Starbucks, mini-market, good restaurants. Rooms are clean, only negative is rooms need more drawer space for clothes. Staff friendly and helpful."
Had issue with room keys    Went down to reissue key everyday on final day had a trainee that was taking way to long. However management did take care of breakfast.  Also 39 to park on a 550 per nite room. Think it was excessive
"This is your Home away from home when in the Atlanta Area, Great Staff and Great Evening social...Love this Place!! So if your here for buisness or pleasure..You will feel right at Home(if it's cold request a suite with a fireplace!)"
"Loved every moment of my stay! Beautiful rooms, nice restaurant, fresh food, lovely staff, good fitness room, waterfall shower head, lots of natural light in rooms, convenient parking, impressed by cleanliness"
"Fantastic Rooms.  Hotel has a wonderful vibe and superior customer service.  Nice Amenities.  Nearby local restaurants are great with delicious food and strong drinks.  Only stayed a couple of days, but definitely would return when in Atlanta."
"Clean room , smells good , good food, and drinks ,restaurant around,mall very nice everything around I am really happy , bar nice view, I love the atmosphere of this place the privacy youÃ¢ÂÂre secure thanks"
"Very disappointed.  Long lines for breakfast and no hot water.  Can you imagine going to a hotel and being unable to take a shower?  When we raised it to the front desk they said too bad, talk to Expedia."
We upgraded a few dollars to get a poolside room and it was well worth it. The pool area was nice with a very unique Parisian garden theme. The staff was very professional and courteous. The parking was a bit pricey at $30 per day.
"Billed as upscale, with Ruth's Chris on premise. Anything but. Dirty. Rundown rooms and common areas. Filthy bathroom in common area. Room service forgot the basics like providing water, salt, pepper."
The hotel was conveniently located off the highway and the overall decor was good. The staff is friendly and helpful. The parking was blocked due to construction activities etc and the overall ambience could have been better.
This is a wonderful property!  Great service and location.  The Southern Art Restaurant consistently serves some of the best meals on Earth.  24 hour Room Service and 24 hour Gym access.  The rooms are nice and the beds are cozy.
"Nice hotel. The Concierge, David Michael was wonderful. So welcoming, friendly and helpful. He gets 5 stars!!!! Hotel is super close to stores and restaurants. They also have a car service that will drive you anywhere within 2 miles. Nice alternative to uber!"
"I was in Atlanta for the night and stayed at the Artmore Hotel. It's convenient location, welcoming and friendly staff and closeness to popular Atlanta spots made it a great hotel that I will definitely return to in the future."
"Sashuan was extremely helpful and accommodating! Great customer service really is the difference when it comes to a quality hotel stay. This Westin has always been top notch, I can't recommend it enough."
"A little tired but clean.  helpful professional staff.  Need to update the threadbare towels. Convenient midtown location, good city views.  Starbucks and Einstein bagels right next door.  King suite very roomy, large bathroom."
"Nice clean standard Marriott at a good price. Good touches like smoothie tasters in the morning and cookie and egg nog tasters at night during the holiday season. Nice bedding, good enough workout facilities, friendly staff. Would stay again."
Great hotel! There was a cell phone like vibrating sound heard during the night. Loud enough to check phones to see if they are on. Other than the vibrating noise the visit to The American was superb and recommended!
Thx. so much for your comments. We're so very glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Please come back again soon!
"Great location!  Situated in the midst of malls and top restaurants, yet still private.  Lobby experience is awesome with different themes daily. Fast elevators, great dining, and nice pools as well. No need for a car with Uber and a couple MARTA stations nearby."
Mother's Day for spouse. To get away from home and relax. Not too far from the home and the kind of room allowes for the kids to have their space and my wife to enjoy the separation but still be together.
"We aim to please. Our ""Whatever/Whenever"" customer service is what we are known for and we hope to see you again for your next stay in Atlanta!"
When you are at the Waverly you are a princess!  I will share your comments with my Spa team and hope to see you back soon!
I really enjoyed my stay at the Doubletree Hotel. All staff members were very pleasant and addressed me by name because I'm an honors member. Myself and my guest were treated awesome. I recommend this hotel to everyone. Cookies are always fresh too Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ
"Equipment in fitness center are poor and usually not operating conditions.  Everything else is acceptable.  I have been a regular guest here over last 6 years.  However, my comments about the fitness center have lead to no improvement.  Therefore, this will be my last stay."
try to always stay here for the p-tree road race yearly--good locale-- close to marta for after race- very short walk-- connects to lenox mall-- and close to phipps-- no issues here--not cheap but it does it for me once a year
"Elevator was broken, they serve brown water, room was too hot and checkin was not available until 3pm. I will never go back. On the plus side, they are an all-suite hotel, have a good breakfast and and offer an evening reception."
"Upscale surroundings and amenities, and properly service-oriented front desk staff who know how to treat you in a VIP manner that makes you keep wanting to come back and stay again.  Close to good restaurants, and the hotel dining is very good as well."
Awesome stay in the city of Atlanta I was  attending a Pentecostal assemblies of the world convention great city great fellowship with friends enjoyed every minute of looking forward to returning very soon in the future
"The location is the best for traveling,north of the city and it helps.  The breakfast was great,with many options for the omelette station.  The room very clean and ready.  The lounge area welcoming also."
Everything was awesome...it was a busy weekend but the service was still top notch. The front desk staff as well as valet did everything to make the stay pleasant and accommodating.  I would stay here over and over again.
Front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful. Ellis made check-in speedy and recommended a great place for dinner. The room service staff accommodated my dietary needs with no question and got it right the first time.
Great stay.  We went to Atlanta for hurricane evacuation. Very accommodating-allowed us to bring our cat under the circumstances.  Wonderful staff. Great location. Very nice accommodation. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.
I received stellar customer service by the Valet and Guest Attendants; specifically Shakil. They all went above and beyond to help me get my things set up the day before our event and were perfect gentleman the entire weekend.
Only issue is the bathrooms are extremely small like you in a closet small closet at that. Also the parking was difficult and paying to park was crazy. Why $28 to park.But overall the hotel is nice and the staff was friendly
We had a perfect stay at the Hyatt Place airport North . I will recommend this hotel for my friends and family .your staff was very courteous and professional. The lobby was clean the breakfast was delicious.
I love staying here. The hotel still has a concierge lounge. It is within walking distance of many good restaurants. Always clean - always comfortable   And I get Marriott points!  Why do they make me have 200 words?????
"We received top quality service from Neepa tonight. She was very patient and attentive to our needs, even as she served others. Shout out to David for hiring such a wonderful team member like Neepa! :)"
"I visit quite often as I work in the area and it always feels right!  Great rooms, friendly staff.  Great location right in front of the new Braves baseball stadium.  Shopping and restaurants near by in a safe atmosphere."
"Very nice stay. Rooms very clean. Nice staff, and bar area. Free parking and shuttle service is a plus."
Stayed for a weekend trip with my wife and friends. Conveniently located and nicely appointed with a great staff. They offer a car service making dinner nearby easy. Could use more sound insulation though. Will stay again.
"Stayed there for quick overnight business trip.  The hotel was very clean and comfortable but definately offering the basic lodging needs at a higher quality.  Great location, just not a neighborhood to wander at night.   Would stay there again under similar circumstances."
My stay at the hotel was very satisfying. The location of my room was exactly what i requested. This stay was the best I have experienced so far.  I have recommended  that my family use the hotel's services for our family reunions in the future.
"My stay was good; I did experience a few bugs in the room two consecutive years that I stayed. The overall experience was good. Location ideal, Customer Service was good. No major issues, check out was easy."
"This Marriott's chef cooks better all other Marriott's I have visited . Chef Will Grissett cooked, seasoned and prepared all meals for me and my guest perfectly. Rigatoni and Sausage, Salmon, Lemon Pepper wings. This guy is excellent!"
Hotel is in a nice area-close to great hotels and shopping.  The staff was pleasant and very helpful.  The complimentary breakfast was tasty and plentiful.  The rooms and lobby areas were nice and well-maintained.  Loved the fact that parking was free!!!
My favorite hotel in Atlanta area.  The staff is what truly sets this Doubletree apart!  They work hard to endure their guests have a positive stay.  I stay here many weeks of the year and appreciate that the rooms are always well kept!
"I have no complaints at all! From the staff to the service to the cleanliness, everything was wonderful. The complimentary breakfast was delicious. I will definitely return and I would definitely recommend."
We are shocked and dismayed to learn of your experience. This is certainly not representative of the level of service we strive to extend to our guests. ! Please know your comments are taken very seriously and will be acted upon immediately.
"Amazing service, housekeeping everyday amazing, all Front desk personal beyond amazing. Would recommend this hotel to everyone. Clean and always willing to go over and above to ensure we were taking care of."
"The hotel is close to the airport and is designed beautifully. The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable & the staff was very friendly. The evening reception was awesome. I will definitely stay at this location again."
Booked room day of arrival. Pleased by the quality and view. Nice accommodations for a couple. Bathroom was nice. Staff was very nice. Balcony offered a nice view. Bed was comfortable. Wish we could have stayed longer.
By far the best staff I have experienced as a HHonors member. From the location with in/out parking in ATL to the breakfast quality and the front office staff just a great experience!  Kudos to the staff!
I was surprised by the nightly rate. I've stayed here in the past and the rates have increased dramatically. I booked online for one price but was overcharged more that 200 dollars at checkout. Still waiting on a resolution.
"The good:  friendly help, attractive rooms and bathrooms, upscale amenities.
The bad: very crowded for only two elevators, maid service lacking, no vending machines, cleanliness of common areas need more attention.
You can decide what is important for your stay."
"Staff is very friendly and helpful. You can't beat the location to take in all the sites downtown. You can walk everywhere. It was a little out of my comfortable price range, but the location was worth it to me."
Doubletree was wonderful!!  Staff is excellent and rooms are beautiful and clean.  I stay here when I am in the Atlanta area and I am never disappointed.   Breakfast was hot and fresh. The renovated rooms are amazing!
"I travel quite a bit and I found the staff of this hotel to have some of the best customer service skills that I have ever experienced.  They are pleasant, helpful and very accommodating to your needs."
"The hotel was wonderful. The staff was polite, happy and helpful in every way possible. They offered free hot breakfast every morning. When we come back we will be staying at the hyatt house Atlanta again."
"What a great find! The rooms are clean, the staff is helpful and friendly, they have a  great breakfast and the hotel is located only one block from America's Mart. My go to place twice a year when I travel to Market."
We are glad you enjoyed your stay and our renovations. We apologize for the problems you encountered and hope you will return so we can show you we have corrected these issues.
Good hotel for business traveler.  Close to I-75 but not noisy.  Good restaurant in the hotel and several good ones close by.  Normally quiet but can get noisy with baseball teams during the summer.  Pool and workout area always clean.  Good bar.
"Great, location across from Phipps Plaza in Buckhead. Solid amenities, food and bar service; very good rooms with comfortable beds. Very Reasonable room rates = very good value. Friendly staff. Some confusion in checking in, but all was successfully resolved."
"Good hotel, good area, good price, but could be cleaner. They need to clean the little area like outside the tub and the corners of the rugs. It appears it use to be an apartment complex. But staff is friendly."
"Have stayed here several times for business and speaking presentations and i highly recommend the Hotel. I have in the past stayed at other similar properties in Atlanta including the Four Seasons and the Ritz. This is the pick of the litter in Atlanta. Thanks,"
Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast at hotel main restaurant was very good. Check in and out was very smooth. Location to other restaurants and convention center is within easy walking distance.
Superb hotel including excellent breakfast in a prime location. Would recommend this hotel a would not hesitate to return. Parking across the road is $5 flat rate. If you are lucky you can park in front of the hotel for free!!!
"We are glad you enjoyed your stay here and we apologize for the WiFi problem you encountered. 
We hope you will be staying with us on your next trip our way. Thank you."
"This hotel as everything, and even surrounded by LOTS of City Attractions, in walking distance!!  Great bang for you buck!!!  Oh yeah, and join their rewards/membership program as well...you won't regret it, I promise!!!!"
Room was filthy. Main light in living area didn't work. Toilet was clogged. The deadbolt on the door to the adjoining room was broke and maintenance had to come fix it. I would not recommend this hotel.
"Booked through TripAdvisor with no issues. Hotel Ellis was in a great location and everything about our stay, room and experience was flawless. We plan to come back in the future! Hats off to everyone involved in such a great business."
Everything was on point from the cocktail at check-in to the meal that we had in Champions. The bed was comfortable and made it easy to get rest for the meetings the next day. Extremely close to the convention center which was awesome!
"Workers were rude, did not care about the well being of their customers. Food was horrible. Had to stay in the cold room for two days. I would rate this hotel a 1 star. Everyone was rude and unfriendly"
"My short stay here was very nice! Sean the bartender was such a pleasure to meet! So much energy and wonderful to talk to. Thank you! Can't wait to come back! I will diffently spread the word! 
Thank you!
Lori K.
Lori K."
"Our stay began with the valet asking us ""are you sure you are at the right hotel?"" And went downhill from that. TERRIBLE and non-responsive service, a complete embarrassment to the Mandarin brand. BAD!"
Traveled to Atlanta for long week of business.The Regis is centrally located and within walking distance to literally every attraction and made shopping Super Easy. Just a few Blocks away from The Dome and great eateris!!
"Staff, room, airport shuttle, everything! Check-in was very pleasant and efficient. Easy access to interstate. Quick overnight stay before flying out of ATL but would definitely stay longer. Excellent! Definitely recommend!"
"The hotel is old and shabby. It is need of a complete renovation. Modern amenities are missing or of poor quality.  The staff is indifferent. The room was quiet, but the air conditioner was unreliable."
My experience was great except for my Sunday experience with the cook who made the omelets. I was very offended by her behavior and expected better service from a staff member working for a prestigious Hotel brand.
"This hotel fit the bill for what we needed in an airport hotel. Shuttle service was reliable room was clean. The check in process was quite busy and long, but otherwise a good experience. I would stay here again."
"We booked our room to coincide with an event at the Cobb Galleria Centre, very impressed with the staff-they were very pleasant & helpful! Room was more than expected, very clean & comfortable.  Whole experience was awesome, we will definitely be back!"
"along with the compimentary managers reception and the breakfast, the staff were very friendly, attentive and professional. i would definitely recommend staying here!! room was great, bed was absolutely comfortable!!"
"Stay at the Artmore over the weekend.  What a great hotel and stay.  This hotel was clean, had charm and a great staff!  Can't wait until my next visit.  Breakfast had a great selection and the bar provide great night caps. The courtyard is amazing."
"The hotel has recently been completely renovated. My room was great, loved the new bar and restaurant.  The hotel needed updating and got it!! As always, staff is very friendly and helpful.  Thanks for another great stay!"
My first stay at a Ritz Carlton Hotel was a nice experience. The staff is top quality. Room was in very good condition. The food was excellent in The Gallery and In-Room dining.  I would highly recommend The Ritz Carlton Buckhead.
Just stayed here for only 1 night but would certainly come back again. Spacious and very nice rooms. Fully equipped gym with all you need. Very good breakfast and a good place to have dinner. Very good and friendly service.
"this was obviously an apartment complex at one point. No elevators and having to climb steps to take luggage in was not what I expected. Amenities in room were subpar....not enough coffee or creamer. Grounds were nice, and convenient to Cobb Galleria"
I loved everything about this hotel. Staff was great it was very clean and good location. It was confusing finding the room but everything else was great. I will most definitely be staying again. Loved it
"Stayed there one night. Hotel is undergoing renovation to the lobby, restaurant, etc.

Staff was very courteous and friendly. Room was top notch. The breakfast food was very good. 

Considering the construction work going on, it was a most enjoyable stay."
"We brought 30 high school students to Atlanta for an event. When we arrived, check in was streamlined and very smooth. The staff was extremely cordial and helpful. Our rooms were conveniently located. The facility is attractive and the rooms are very nice."
"Attendant at breakfast was rude and embrassing to say the least. At check in promised a refrigerator that was on a Monday, we didnÃ¢ÂÂt get it until Wednesday the last night of our stay after we followed by up"
Excellent hotel in a very good area. Service is great and the rooms are clean. Hotel is within walking distance of plenty of restaurants and shopping.  The only recommendation I could make is for the hotel to add some lighting to their garage.
We hope to see you again soon! Yes we are a hidden gem! Near everything but tucked away! #greatstays@homewoodsuitesatlantacumberland
"Zaydah and Nicki (""The Dream Team"") provided awesome customer service while I was in town this week.  Handled the check-in process efficiently and were extremely friendly! They made the day an awesome end to a very hectic day of travel."
"The thing I didn't like was the lay out. The doors face the lobby, my girls sleeped  on the fold out couch and it was noisy in the lobby. The  dinner and breakfast we had at the restaurant was very good."
"Checking in was an amazing experience thanks to Michael. He went the extra yard with attention to detail and ensuring our rooms were exactly what we needed.

We're still waiting to hear him sing though!"
"Kind, attentive to guests and helpful staffs. Nice and generous breakfast. Easy to park. Internet speed is good. And the room was really comfortable, clean and spacious. I will definitely come back here."
"We are certainly happy that your stay was a "" happy one"" - Thank You for traveling."
"someone was smoking pot in the room next door, the A/C venting system is terrible, my room stunk so bad i couldnt breath, and the manager was suppose to call back for a solution, but never did"
"I was going on a 8 day vacation and started at the hotel in Atlanta...my bed was very comfortable.
Room was very clean and comfortable.  Food in the AM was very good.
Staff was very friendly and helpful"
"All Staff was very friendly. Location directly across from Lenox mall, we walked there. Parking is pricey but vallet attendants are very very polite and helpful. Bed and pillows very comfortable, loved the robes."
"Wife and I stayed here a week and we had very nice accommodations with helpful staff. She attended a business conference and they were very accommodating and the place is a value. Very close to all Atlanta, Georgia attractions."
Not the cheapest but very comfortable. A lovely building and good location for visiting the sites in Atlanta. The parking is expensive but it was valet and we could leave our car until 2pm the next day.
We look forward to welcoming you in March!
We had a great stay at this historic hotel.  Service is great and the breakfast is very good.  The hotel is within walking distance to MARTA and is very close to entertainment and restaurants.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs also right off the trolley line.
"From check in until checkout, our experience at this hotel was excellent! The breakfast had lots of options, was continually and freshly updated, and very clean. The staff was friendly and accommodating."
"This is a very nice hotel, good location, close to interstate, shopping and restaurants. One suggestion is more lighting in the parking lot, otherwise great hotel, comfy beds. I would recommend this hotel."
it was absolutely amazing and i have a great time. i enjoyed every bit of my stay. everybody was really nice and answered every question i had. the breakfast could've been a bit better but other than that it was awesome.
I will definitely stay here again! The room was great; large and clean. The free breakfast had something for everyone. Can't beat it. Stay here.
Guest of the day is a nice feature.  Clean and nice location to a couple restaurants.  Like the rooms with a sitting area.  Ask for room facing entrance because of road noise if staying in the back of hotel
"Our room was spacious. The couch though was old needed replacing of the gross cushions. The sheets on the bed were pilling. There were several lights out-2 in one bathroom, one in the other, as well as one in a bedroom. Housekeeping came late."
"One of the best Hotel i have ever been, just like a paradise.  Room very elegant and clean. Well equipped Fitness center with a pool... Open 24 hours.
Buckhead where is located the hotel is the best Atlanta area for night life.
Had great time!"
"This was my second stay here. Barring any major changes, this will be my go-to hotel in the Atlanta area. Large rooms, clean bathrooms, homey, well-designed spaces. Few hotels can match the great breakfast buffet."
"We truly value your comments and are glad to hear that our staff was friendly and accommodating during your stay.  We look forward to having you stay with us again for another Artful Trip.

Thanks"
"You can always count on us for peace and quiet, Chris! We hope youÃ¢ÂÂll come back and stay with us again soon."
"I just stayed at the Hyatt Regency Christina in Atlanta.   The property and amenities are top notch and the service was excellent across the board.   I typically stay at Hyatt Properties when traveling for business, I will now be a regular guest at this location."
Very clean hotel. Front Desk Personnel were very nice and helpful.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.!!!! The bed was very comfortable.  The room contained a safe that was very easy to use. We had a great view.  There was plenty of parking.
"We're so sorry if you had an inconvenience during your stay with us. Please feel free to reach out to our team at qualityatlgh@hyatt.com. Again, we're very sorry, and hope you'll choose us again."
My favorite luxury hotel.  I am just beginning to travel more but have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in the past.  I is just wonderful.  Comfortable and home-like but with the luxury I could very much get used to!
"Located close to everything.  Mercedes Benz stadium, Aquarium, College Football Hall of Fame, CNN.  Hotel staff was nice and knowledgeable.  Parking garage is a little tight but we were driving a 15 passenger van."
Happy Valentines Day!
"Indoor and outdoor pool. Patio seats right out from your doorstep. The occasional military aircraft to watch. Close to major highways. Not in the heart of town, so it is away from the crime and commotion."
"Stayed 2 nights, right off the I75 15 minutes from Downtown. Very pleasant staff and comfortable beds. Shuttle service provided for anything within 3km, plenty of restaurants available within the 3kms. Will book this hotel on my way back home."
The staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Always trying to meet anyone's needs. I noted many repeat business customers which is a testimony to this hotel. If I'm traveling in the area I will definitely be back here
"Staff was so nice and accommodating! Location is amazing and hotel is so pretty. Gym is great!

Only complaint is I left something at the hotel and they said they didn't have it.... when I arrived back to pick it up they had it -"
Staff never missed an opportunity to greet us and to make my toddler's stay special and comfortable. Rooms and hotel in general were impeccably clean and comfortable. I would never stay anywhere else!
"Great location, clean and modern comfort! Had a great stay and extremely quiet on the 12th floor. Professional, friendly attendant checking us in. Loved the linens, clean rooms and high ceilings. Tip- valet park on Carnegie St. not Peachtree St."
We checked in on friday. Check in was breeze.I already had accumulated gold points and used that. We were given room in the 4th floor. Room was neat and clean.Internet is free and the breakfast was excellent. Overall a safe place to stay with kids.
"Stayed just one night as I was passing through Atlanta. I wish it could have been longer. This is an elegant hotel with a wonderful staff. The room was clean, quiet, felt safe and luxurious. Everything you think of when you think Four Seasons."
"I hesitate to provide this review, as I want to be selfish.  This is hotel is excellent, both in accommodations and food, and is also located such that you hardly know you are literally right off I-285.  I highly recommend it."
"Nice hotel, but be prepared to be charged $8 per day for parking.  Nothing special about it, just a way to fleece a few more bucks out of you.  There is a Hampton and various Marriot properties very close that do not charge for that."
"Just a fun night out. Great facility and. Very convenient . Rooms are very very nice with a view. The bar was quiet and we enjoyed a drink before dinner before going to the Villa Christina restaurant 
Would go again"
"One night stay, two double beds, a spectacular room- it was entitled. The room was clean. Valet attendants were exceptional. The Trace restaurant was only open on Saturday for brunch till noon which wasn't helpful."
"Great hotel for the airport. Shuttle took a while to come to the pickup area. Check-in attendant was very friendly. Breakfast was simple but good. Overall a great stay, especially if you're looking for a quick place to sleep during a layover in ATL."
"We stayed there while waiting for further connecting flight. Hotel is nice and very clean, the staff is very friendly. The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable, we most certainly book again with them in our next trip to atlanta"
"Amazing place to stay, so close to all we wanted to do. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, and room was impeccable. 
Loved this getaway weekend and will defniitely be back!
Can't wait."
"A very comfortable hotel at a price that was value for money over the course of our stay. Could do with a little redecocration, but that was a minor blight more than compensated for by the excellance of the staff."
"Visiting family in Georgia over the holidays, decided to stay at the Embassy Suites, Galleria. Great choice.  The hotel was recently remodeled and was nicely decorated for the holiday season.  Clean, convenient to shopping, close to the interstate, complimentary breakfast and shuttle service."
The staff is VERY RUDE!  Elevators feel like they are going to fall at any moment. Rooms are clean. The hallways are musty. The hotel has offered a free weekend stay because my spouse is a frequent member at this hotel chain.
"This is not a good place to stay.  Dinner was great but room had ants and dated.  They did compensate us for the ants, but I would say there are better places to stay.  The transportation to the airport was the best part."
"Clean, spacious with a good vibe.  Layout of the hotel and the skyline view (only on one side of the hotel) are excellent.  Sometimes the service at the bar were overwhelmed but they were always trying to keep you happy."
"Amy, thank you taking time to leave such a great review.  We will pass on your kind words to all the staff.  We look forward to having you stay with us again on your next trip."
Staff was very friendly. Check in was speedy and painless. Location was perfect for the places I traveled around Atlanta. Room was a great size and the price was spot on. Quiet and cozy. Thumbs up Hyatt Place!!!
"Excellent hotel. Great service. Very good location for the Georgia World Congress Center, Coca Cola World, Olympic Park, Phillips Arena, Georgia Aquarium, and Mercedes Benz Stadium. I have stayed at this hotel many times and have never had a bad experience."
"Poor attitude of check-in clerk.  Toilet not working well, shower head not strong nor offering different settings, tub slippery.  Elevator and ice machines not working.  Only good thing was the cookie offered, and that just is not enough to cut it!"
Clean room!  Nice Bathroom for getting ready.  Employees were EXCEPTIONALLY NICE and helpful  and PROFESSIONAL!   Beautiful view of the city.   Toilet in bathroom ran   water pressure was low.  Would stay  again
This is an excellent place to stay. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very professional.   I loved being located next to Centennial Park and the College Football Hall of Fame.  Great downtown location!
"Clean, Comfortable and Nice Breakfast. I needed a ride back to the office about 8:00PM but the shuttle driver said the 4-mile trip was too far. Really?"
"From the moment we pulled into the parking lot, this location never disappointed!  Great service, excellent facilities.  The room was spotless and well furnished.  Linens were fresh.  Food in the restaurant was delicious as well.  I will be staying here again!"
I enjoyed my stay this weekend at wingate/buckhead.Marie and Monique are two amazing women that are so thoughtful and friendly they make your stay one that you want to come back.The rooms were extra clean and the bed comfortable!
Hotel is located in great location to the shops and restaurants! Parking is high if u have a car.... Would have given it 5 if not for water leak in my room! Overall Buckhead is nice and safe area.... I would visit again!
"Pretty standard Doubletree.  Good breakfast (not free), paid self-park and valet service.  Room was comfortable and clean.  Had a lot of freeway noise, but other than that, no real complaints from my visit."
We love this place every single time we visit! It is always extremely clean and the staff is so friendly! We love hanging out that the downstairs lounge and walking to Bucket Shop Cafe across the street. Great place!
"No hot water for shower. Had to request a price adjustment. Old smelling rooms. Breakfast was disappointing.
Must pay to park in lot.
 Positive note is the shuttle service takes you directly to the mall & back."
"Love this hotel, it's one of my favorite places to go in Atlanta.  The spa is a CAN'T MISS!  Lounge by the pool and enjoy the great outdoor patios at night when the weather cools down.  Definitely your spouse here for an amazing stay-cation."
No pet fee which is rare. Free food and drinks!  Excellent staff.  The suite we stayed in had two rooms which was great since we were traveling with my parents.  One of the best values!  I loved the cocktail hour!
"Overall is is a good hotel.  There were no refridgerators in the room.  Cleaning staff did well.  My package was supposed to have the breakfast included, but then it wasn't.  They gave me a single breakfast ticket, instead of just simply making it right."
"Nice location- easy access off interstate
Close to wonderful restaurants 
Staff was very friendly and helpful
Conference room and staff were great
Enjoyed my stay - able to combine business and pleasure"
"Adam Wightman, Ibram and other staff members were incredibly patient, responsive, caring and professional in managing an unexpected adverse situation during the trip (unrelated to the hotel).  They went out of their way to help, and followed up exactly when promised.  THANK YOU!"
"I enjoyed my stay very much.  HGI rarely (and then barely) disappoints... This was an awesome stay.  Staff was friendly and helpful. Room and hotel was clean and comfy, and the food was good. My omelet was the best ever!  Traveling alone I felt safe."
"Recently stayed here with family. Overall, the room was nice but the breakfast was very mediocre. The omelets used canned mushrooms instead of fresh or frozen mushrooms. Definitely, we not stay here again."
"Very friendly staff, room was clean. Room service was prompt. The room we had was a bit small and lacking in some creature comforts like the bath amenities could have included a bubble bath. Thanks to Ron for his friendly service!"
"Nice hotel with clean, comfortable rooms.  Nice views over Atlanta.  Convenient to several local businesses and restaurants.  Get downstairs early for breakfast.  Consistent with the Embassy Suites brand.  Thanks for your hospitality!"
This place is great. Two bedrooms and a pull out couch. The value you get for the price is excellent. Very friendly and helpful staff. Only negative was parking on the weekends but the staff made sure you could park somewhere on the property.
"I stayed here for a week for a company event.  It is well located--near MARTA and within walking distance of sites, attractions, and good restaurants.  The hotel was easy to navigate and the staff friendly and helpful.

A very ""Westin"" experience.  :)"
"Great hotel -- the appearance, staff, food, etc.  It is also located in an area convenient to the Atlanta Downtown and surrounded by many great restaurants.  The food in this restaurant is great.   I highly recommend this hotel."
We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Thx. so much for your comments. We hope you'll stay with us again!
Great experience at this hotel. The front desk clerk Matthew was very nice. The room was extremely clean. It just has a comfy feel to it. I can't wait to stay there again. The balcony was a nice touxh as well
With this being an Homewood Suites it was disappointing that they were so cheap on the food and beverages for breakfast and evening social. They were also short on towels in the rooms and plates and silver for breakfast.
Room was inviting with small personal touches for the guest such as fruit infused water in the lobby-different kind each day. Loved the sauna room in the workout area! Staff are very friendly. Nice place to have a conference event.
"Service, comfort, luxury..itÃ¢ÂÂs got it all. The hotel shuttle service anywhere in the Buckhead area is prompt and friendly. The Buckhead location is great for the best of restaurant choice and the best of shopping."
"Jazy Jeff was a cool dude. He was nice, friendly, and made sure I was completely satisfied. I'd def come back to see him!

Overall, the hotel was clean, comforting, and in a great location. Lots of nearby attractions. Will definitely stay here again!"
"First time at midtown location. Had a wonderful experienc, staff helpful and friendly especially Ryan who checked us in and made sure we had everything we needed. Dad enjoyed the breakfast downstairs and the recommendations of local restaurants was perfect!"
I had a horrible start thanks to hotel Indigo midtown. But hyatt was there to the rescue. I love hyatt. The rpoms were clean and spacious. And within walking distance to the convention center. We had fun
"Great spot For a meeting, plenty of space, easy access, great food and great service. The staff was courteous and helpful, will recommend to all of my colleagues for their future travel plans into the north Atlanta area."
"We truly appreciate your comments and hope that your procedure went well.  We look forward to having you stay with us again and hopefully it will be for some fun.

Thanks,"
Rooms were very nice and very clean.  Convention center was great!!!  It accommodated our big group.  Food was very good.  Excellent customer service. Walking distance from mall.  It has a pool.  Had a great time.
The food was irresistible and the ambience was stellar as usual. I'd like to personally thank the staff for their warm reception. I highly recommend this cafÃÂ© if you are in the Buckhead area whether you on business or shopping.
"The whole experience was incredible! Beautiful architecture within, nice rooms with potential for great view of Atlanta's downtown.The staff was wonderful. There was always someone there to assist. The restaurant options in hotel good. There's a starbucks in lobby which was fantastic for me."
"Great stay! Thank you! Really enjoyed the stay - clean rooms, great staff, good food. Stayed for a conference at the Cobb Galleria and was very grateful for the shuttle service to Cobb Galleria! Will definitely re-book if the conference is at the Cobb Galleria"
"The conference staff truly went above and beyond to make me feel at home during my week-long stay.  Specifically, Miss Janine and her ever-present smile made every day special.  She and her colleagues ensured that the space and setup was ideal for every breakout."
Very pleased with our hotel stay.  Bed was comfortable.  Room was clean.
"We've stayed here several times and it's our first choice in the Atlanta area.  Staff is friendly helpful and professional, rooms are large and clean and it's a great value.  Free parking and a great breakfast--what more do you need?!"
"Very excellent n accommodating because my flight was backed up room beautiful,all staff awesome and this was my first ever trip to atlanta this stay was right near all the downtown colleges and not to far from other attractions thanks for the fabulous stay :)"
"Last evening we hosted an educational seminar and dinner at this hotel.  Even with a large number of clients in varying stages/levels of MS, the venue was easily accessible, well stocked and clean.  The chicken supper was enjoyable and the cheesecake, exceptional."
"We have a family of ten, so finding the right place is difficult. The condo style living with such a great staff was perfect for families. If ever I am in the area again, I KNOW where I am going to stay!"
"Spacious, Comfortable, Friendly - we'll take that!  Thanks so much for taking the time to share your experience and for recognizing Dao.  Come see us again soon!"
"Always a pleasure to stay at this hotel! Rooms were exceptionally clean and the beds are heavenly.......We love staying here for an ""in town vacation "" from the suburbs. The lobby maintained its usual elegance despite the renovations of the adjoining spaces."
"Located right across the street from the Fox Theater, I've rarely been to a better located hotel than this. Absolutely the best hotel in Atlanta, maybe even in Georgia! The rooms themselves are also very clean and spacious"
I would not compare this hotel to a motel 6. Don't waste your money. The hotel is filthy!!! There is no telling what you will come out this hotel with from the filth!!! Stay somewhere else!!! The only thing about this location is the convenience.
"Stayed here when flying out of Atlanta.  Drurys are nice because free drinks, breakfast and dinner food bar.  Free parking and shuttle to airport with your stay.  Nice staff, location is nice with restaurants and pubs close to the hotel.  Will stay again."
"This hotel was very close to airport  and they had a shuttle service Decor was lovely, food was delicious. Rooms were very nice, clean loved the layout. It was close to to transportation. I would stay here again. I"
I was charged 26.00 for WiFi hoping for an adjustment after I was told that I was to use WestinGuest. The service was excellent but I was surprised the room was not cleaned for the second day. Because I was alone it worked out.
"Luxiourious hotel , lovely rooms, beautiful area very close to an amazing park .. however hetel seemed to target older age not families. staff were ok , not super friendly or helpful .. restaurant staff on premises were not pleasant."
Absolutely loved the atmosphere and the contemporary design. Staff was great and accommodating. Plus the location is just right. Close walking distance to many downtown attractions! Will be back again.
"This property is an excellent 3/4 star hotel.  It is clean, well-maintained, and has a friendly staff.  Nearby food options are excellent and nightlife is not too far away.  Kid friendly and cozy with good business utilities."
Clean and friendly! Our kids enjoyed the pool table and swimming in a pool while downtown Atlanta swirls by. It was a 5 minute walk to the Georgia aquarium and the park. Lots of relaxing seating in the lobby!
We stayed here for when we came for a family wedding.  The hotel was excellent...the staff helpful and friendly and the rooms were very comfortable and spotlessly clean. It was very conveniently located for us...about three blocks from where the wedding and reception were held
"The staff at this hotel are very helpful, friendly and provide great service.  The rooms are clean and well maintained and the beds are excellent.  Bathrooms are standard and could be a little spruced up but not bad.  Great weekend rates."
Stayed here when checking out Georgia Tech for our son. the staff is super friendly and helpful. The rooms appear to be newly decorated and are nicely appointed. We will definitely stay at this great boutique-like hotel again!
"Excellent job of completely refurbishing an older hotel.  Inside decor was breath taking with multiple places to get away and enjoy seclusion.  Heating/cooling was quiet and efficient.  As always, the beds were extremely comfortable and service was outstanding"
"Helpful Staff here.  Nice location.  Can easily walk to a lot, including food, drink, stores, even a mall.  Can also walk to the MARTA station easy enough.
Rooms are clean.  Fairly priced given the location.
Not sure on parking as I used train and cabs."
"It was my first time to GA from DC so I was excited, to my surprise everything sucked. The breakfast was awful. The room was so  small and housekeeping never cleaned my room. Also downtown atl seems to be a rough area."
"Clean room; Excellent staff.  Will return.  Breakfast buffet was very nice with excellent selection.  Enjoyed the location, convenient location on North West side of Atlanta. Plan on returning in October."
"We agree and we appreciate your comments so much! 
Amos is an absolutely amazing member of our team and your compliments are so very much appreciated. 
Live it up again soon at W Atlanta-Buckhead!"
The hotel was very nice and clean and accommodating. We stayed in the king room on the 4th floor and it was very spacious. The customer service was very good and the southern hospitality was very welcoming. I would suggest staying here!!!
Excellent hotel accommodations with extraordinarily staff focused on customers every need. Concierge very knowledgeable of the area. Very pleasurable experience for our family. We recommend the Ritz Carlton Hotel to anyone that desires a perfect stay.
"Good location if you're doing business at World Congress Center. Restaurant under construction during my stay. Club floor very nice with full breakfast selections, very good evening bites and libations. People are terrific and helpful. Classically beautiful. Very efficient for business travel."
doubletree was a very nice hotel. the staff all were helpful and pleasant. i would stay here again.the breakfast was more than a typical one you would recieve.the value for my money was very good.looking forward to my next trip.
"Yes, we have been around since 1983 and have a long tradition of pride in what we do. Please come back and see us soon!"
The front desk sent us to the top of the parking garage to watch the 4th of July fireworks.  What a wonderful experience!  We watched with many of the local residents  as fireworks exploded in a panoramic view of the city!
"It was a great time! The room service was impeccable and the room was immaculate. No loud music or loud neighbors. The area is very well lit, with a homely feeling. I didn't want to leave. I will return at my earliest convenience."
Very lovely staff and accommodating.  Nice balcony views of the city and the full moon through the windows as you soaked in the hot tub. Nice location to walk to many different shops and restaurants.  Walked all over even at night and felt safe.
"Visited for 2 nights for a recent business trip. Every staff member was very pleasant and provided service. Hotel is clean, nicely furnished and decorated. Close to mall and many restaurants. Enjoyed my stay."
Our apologies about the apartment building that is being developed next door to us. We too await its completion. Thanks for the response to TA.
"The hotel was very clean and the service was great ! Our children really enjoyed the pool and the overall stay was great. During our stay people did get trapped on the elevator but it was handled promptly,we would definitely  stay here again."
"Nice, clean convenient place for a weekend in Atlanta. They have clean rooms, a modern look, nice pool and spa. The staff was friendly and accomadating. Very reasonable pricing for the area. Right across from the new stadium."
Stayed one week in Villa Christina. This luxury hotel features very spacious rooms. Rooms have nice furniture and the bathroom offers a huge walk-in shower. Mattress was very comfortable. Excellent breakfast but not included. Parking garage is not included.
Great clean hotel with great service! My room was very spacious. Hotel employees were very helpful and friendly. I will definitely be returning & I highly suggest others book with Hyatt. Thank you Hyatt for making my weekend great!
Close to tourist spots. Big clean room. Staff very friendly and attentive. Good breakfast selection. Close to diners for an evening meal or eat in the hotel. Hotel shuttle for up to three mile journeys. Free daily newspapers. Good TV channels.
"The room was nice, spacious. The staff was friendly and attentive to our needs. The room was a jr. suite with kitchen and nice bathroom. The location is close to the 285/75 intersection and very easy to get to the mall and restaurants around."
"The pocket door to the bathroom kept getting jammed in the pocket. It may have been over painted. Every time I wrestled the door free housekeeping 
keeping would shove it back in the slot. 
Then the struggle would begin again."
"The breakfast is GREAT!  The bed is to die for!  The room is very clean!  Personally, I enjoyed the decor before they recently remodeled it!  But it is newly remodeled.   GREAT service.  GREAT staff.  You will enjoy your stay!"
Doesn't look like something fancy is in the inside from the looks of the outside... but once you walk in... its amazing!  ITs very nice!  better than any other conveniently priced hotels my husband and I have ever stayed at.
"Arrived late at 1am. Staff was friendly, quick check in and clean rooms. Breakfast smelled great, but we opted out of the $10.95 made to order breakfast and hit the road. East access from the interstate. Plenty of free and available parking."
We stayed here for a family event.  The remodeled lobby is nice.  Our first room smelled of cleaning chemicals so strong that we had to request another room.  We were accommodated and we appreciated it.  The rooms decor is only adequate.
"enjoyed my stay very much.  staff very friendly.  Evan, in particular, was very helpful.  rooms are spacious, clean, modern.  easy to get around from midtown location. recommend highly for a business trip."
"This is a very hip hotel with easy access to The Fix Theatre and nearby restaurants in downtown Atlanta. The bar drinks were a bit pricy and the rooms were a bit small, but overall the experience was very pleasant."
They didn't have a microwave nor a refrigerator after paying a Hugh cost a night. Floors had a juice spill on it. Toilet did not work good and they didn't want to give you clean towels when you asked for them.
We were in town for a concert at the new Braves stadium. We loved this hotel AND they offered a shuttle to the venue so we didn't have to fight or pay for parking. We were very happy with our stay. Yeah!
"This hotel feels like a cheap motel. Rooms are not very clean, sometimes housekeeping is not done during the day, and the quality of food at the restaurant is not that great"
"VeryClean, requested room on 1st floor and actually got it.  Usually don't. There was a cocktail lounge and some dinners.  I would recommend. Although not part of Holiday Inn, I did get Priority Club points."
"Location was great, desk staff a bit aloof, robotic interaction. I was able to get my room before 3pm, which was great, but looked like floor never vacuumed from previous tenant, glitter everywhere.  Otherwise room was fine."
Enjoyed a 24 hour business meeting stay at hotel. Great service and food. Room was comfortable and clean. Front desk was responsive and efficient in check in and check out. Definitely would return to this hotel
"Michael the gentleman who works at the front desk was so attentive. He was very helpful during our time in Atlanta. The staff in general were amazing, and helpful. Definitely would recommend staying here"
"Great Location, we were visiting ZooAtlanta. Parking close to hotel. All staff very friendly! Room super clean. Very comfortable . Used Wifi with no problem! Breakfast had so many choices and very tasty!! Definitely recommend this hotel!!"
"We couldn't ask for a better response from our amazing guests!  
We're so happy you enjoyed the dining and shopping options available in and around our hotel!"
Abdul was very pleasant and offered great service when rectifying the room service bill. Would recommend to others. Thanks!  A pleasant experience all around.  The hotel is nice and clean and great ambience. Great location and staff!
"Upgrade to a premium suite. We had a 1 bedroom with a full kitchen (no utensils or cooking stuff, but called front desk for baking sheet). Big den, washer/dryer and amazing bed. Casey was extremely helpful. Thanks"
"What a marvellous hotel. 

The place is amazing. 

The staff were top drawer!

Not cheap, but worth every penny. 

Bed was so comfortable, in room dining service courteous and professional. 

Restaurant food was brilliant and service was epitome of southern hospitality!!

Recommended!"
"My husband and I have found our new ""go to"" Atlanta hotel. The rooms, the courtyard, the bar, the breakfast ALL exceeded expectations.  Beautiful with easy access to the Symphony Hall. Great spot to chill. Definitely worth checking out."
"Very nice place to stay. Very professional staff. A great place to stay and feel like home
This is the only Hotel I will stay when visiting Atlanta. If you ever in Atlanta check out the Hyatt. Lot of shopping centers near by."
Excellent place to stay - I would recommend to anyone!  Stayed in a double queen bed room and the beds were extremely comfortable!  Staff went above and beyond to make the stay fun and relaxing.  Nice Job!!!
It was really quite and I love the soft sheets reminds me of heavenly bedding. Lobby was fabulous. Motel was massive. Location was GREAT and grounds were beautiful. They offer a  shuttle for free anywhere in a 3 mile radius .
The Doubletree does an excellent job of treating me better than the other hotels in the same vicinity.  I always feel welcome and no request is too big to accomodate.  Well trained staff are attentive and service minded.
We have had this issue with other guests as well.  We have ordered new sofa beds that are queen sized to better allow for future guests.  Beds should arrive the end of April 2014.
I had a great experience at this hotel. The staff is amazing and their shuttle service to local attractions/restaurants is certainly a bonus! The rooms were extremely clean and spacious. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone.
"This is a great deal, at $169/night, the suite was like a condo, with great furniture, in small buildings. Th ebed was of great quality, everything was really good. There is free breakfast in the lobby building, a pool (seasonal). Overall, a great value."
"Pretty standard for a W.  I find the service a bit inconsistent, but the rooms are beautiful and  the bar has a good energy.  This location is always cheaper that the downtown spot and its still a convenient area.  Will stay here again."
Overall very good experience. Marta right across the street should you be seeing a game at the Mercedes Benz Stadium. Maybe 30 minute train ride. Very quit and clean hotel. They have valet and full service as you would expect
"The hotel was priced way to high for the amenities. The bar, breakfast area, and shuttle services were awesome! The hotel rooms smelt bad, the carpet in the hotel needed a good shampooing and the customer service personnel were OK at best."
"What a great place to stay! Very clean, nice furnishings, yummy breakfast and such a helpful staff. They told us all the fun places to go in a short time and how to navigate the public transportation."
"Very nice hotel in an energetic part of Atlanta. The service is excellent and a very friendly staff.  My room was spacious and very clean.  Nice bath, large.  My only complaint, no dresser or drawers for clothes."
Had a very quick stop in Atlanta and stayed at the JW Marriott for a night.  Got an early morning workout in the fitness facilities at the hotel.  The room was large and extra comfortable.  The only negative was the parking.
"Beautiful historic hotel with stunning atmosphere. We were upgraded to a two bedroom suite by the nice lady at the reception. Very spacious room, comfortable beds. Location of the hotel is perfect. We are very happy  with our choice."
The airport shuttle driver was very helpful and the shuttle was clean and comfortable. The hotel staff was attentive and helpful and the hotel was clean and we given a late checkout to give us a little more time to recover from our flight.
Great place to stay for an extended business trip. comfortable and roomy. The only negative was the breakfast. Sausage was undercooked.
This is a great hotel if you are flying in and out of Atlanta airport. Fast reliable shuttle service. Nice rooms that are moderately priced. The food is outstanding in the restaurant. Rooms are getting a little tired but are clean and spacious.
"the service was great . We enjoyed daily exercise and the Spa . The room and amenities were very much acceptable . The location was super . The complimentary shuttle service was very helpful.
I recommend this hotel to everyone ."
Hotel needs to be updated. The bathroom ceiling seemed old. Very clean beds and floor. The staff assisted where they could and helpful to any questions I had. Surrounding location has lots of construction. Therefore it was very congested in the area.
"Went with seven others and was happy how clean the rooms were.  Beds were also comfortable.  Rented four rooms. It was close to some great restaurants. Staff went above and beyond.  Wish they had refrigerators in the room, though."
"Welcoming Staff, Great Hospitality, a Great Location, Reasonable Price for a Central Location in Atlanta.  Bedrooms what you would expect from a Marriott.  Comfortable 
beds.  Good health facility.  Great swimming pool.  Easy parking in adjacent garage."
We chose the Grand Hyatt for our anniversary staycation and we couldn't have been happier. We were welcomed by everyone and the special request I made to surprise my husband was met and exceeded. We will definitely keep this hotel in mind for future stays.
"Nothing fancy, clean room. 10 min walk to park area. Lots to do near hotel. Room was clean, staff friendly, etc. Not sure about parking, we Uber'ed in. We felt safe in hotel and cafe by lobby had decent breakfast and service. Nice simple lodging."
I stayed here because I had an early flight the next morning.  It was clean and surprisingly quiet based in the proximity to the airport. Would definitely stay here again.  The staff was very accomodating as well.
"Great location, price, and amenities as the family experienced the world of coca cola, acquarium, and Atlanta United soccer game. The property is well situated to walk to restaurants as well. We had a great stay."

"Very nice hotel. Chic entrance, lobby and rooms. Staff is friendly and helpfull. Room service is outstanding. The young man doing the delivery of breakfast was the nicest person. Very helpfull and ready to go the extra mile."
"When we first checked in the staff was really nice.   Rooms are very spacious and we had not issues at all. We ate at the restaurant downstairs, and it was good.  Great location for early morning flight.  Would stay again"
"The hotel offers suites that are just a short walk to Sun Trust Park, home of the Braves. The hotel is location, location, location, but offers much more. The hotel is the BEST DoubleTree I have ever stayed a; Clean, modern, and friendly staff....Perfection!"
"Great bed, good food, close to airport and has shuttle. Will stay again. The lady at the checkin desk was very helpful to those who aren't travellers. The bus driver gave us good directions once we got to the airport."
This is my second time staying at the hotel. I love it because it is quaint and boutique. The rooms are clean. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I do enjoy staying here. ItÃ¢ÂÂs close to everything downtown.
"Thx. so much for your review, and for being our guest. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us during the PAW convention. We were so glad to host you all. We hope you'll come back and stay with us again, soon!"
This hotel was clean and the people were  professional.
"good location world of coke, the Ga aquarium, the food is definitely over priced, the rooms are a standard hotel room size, no different from any other room some where else for half of the cost. I should have stayed at the embassy suites"
"hotel was clean and quiet, only complaint is you have to pay for parking. great seafood restaurant call spondivits right across street. lots of attractions on main street. room was very clean and shower was good and hot."
"Best hotel to feel like home-Sophie at front desk is delightful, rooms are cleans and bathroom has great shower. The covered parking was a bonus when it was storming outside and we didn't have to go out to get into the car."
"Great hotel, beautiful location.  They have great comfortable beds and internet connectivity is perfect!  The meals we were served we excellent...great serving staff. I enjoyed a wonderful experience...highly recommend."
"The room was beautiful and the heated indoor pool was amazing, my 4 year old loved it. The breakfast buffet had a great selection of eggs, bacon, grits, waffles, fruit and much more. We will definitely stay here again!"
Nice hotel. Very convenient to the airport. Room was nice and spacious.  Felt the breakfast could have been better. The current choices were very limited. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. That being said would stay here again.
"PROs

- quiet

CONs

"Super nice, modern hotel. Easy checkin with very courteous staff. Super clean & updated rooms. Less than 5 minutes to Suntrust Park (it is fantastic) and lots of restaurants! This will be our definite go to hotel when watching the Braves."
This was our first time staying in a DoubleTree hotel. It was beautiful and very affordable. The employees were very helpful and friendly. The beds were very comfortable. The room was very clean and beautifully decorated. We will definitely be staying there again!
Booked the room based upon easy access to business location. The hotels was recently updated and the service is great. The rooms are maintained and clean. Breakfast area and selection is good for buffet style serving.
"Comfortable rooms and great service ... convenient location!  Yet, the great experience was the service I received from Havolyn ... concierge par excellent!!!!  She is professional, friendly and spot on with her recommendations.  She made my stay at the Crown Plaza an extra special experience."
"stayed at the hotel and the stay was good; friendly staff, room was fine but needed updating.  Security for the vehicles and people staying there was noticeable, must have a reason, oh yes I remember it's not in the best part of Atlanta."
"Emory Conference Center Hotel has great amenities, great restaurants in the surrounding area but their onsite restaurant is great as well.  Where they excel above most hotels is the quality of service that all their employees provides."
The staff are kind. However the building is very old and obviously painted over poorly. 80's carpet etc. Similar to a motel 6
"I had a wonderful stay and the hotel was very welcoming to our cat.  The only a one time pet deposit was required.  Also, the robes that were provided were quite comfortable and a welcome surprise.  Will definitely stay again."
I am a faithful wyndham rewards customer. I reserved a king room but when I got there my room was given away. I was given a double room inste
"Typical Courtyard, reasonably updated, Bistro restaurant setup, clean rooms, staff was nice.  You can use the shuttle within the business park which was very convenient and the driver was super nice!  Would stay here again."
Fabulous room. We would stay here again and again. Great for couples retreat. The staff was very accommodating and extremely friendly. The hotel has a perfect location for Buckhead shopping and dining
"service and amiability at front desk was excellent, just reported a minumm detail about cleaning and the response was immediate by e mail caring about my issues, despite it was not solved. i had a fantastic view and slept wonderful"
Love staying here! Close to food and convenience stores as well as shopping. You get warm cookies at check in. They are chocolate chip and walnut. Beds sleep oh so very nice. Parking is free. About 9 minutes from Lenox square.
The front staff was rude. They were more interested in their conversations than with speaking to guests. House keeping starts playing Mexican music first thing in the morning. Headphones?!  Awful experience.
"Whatever your expectation is of a 5 star hotel, this one will exceed it. Staff was very friendly and attentive and the rooms / amenities were top notch. Walking distance to many great restaurants and attraction. If you are looking for a Mid Town Atlanta"
I was there early for a conference and this hotel was very nice. The rooms were clean and up to date. The digital key is the way to go. The front desk was busy and we went straight to our room and avoided the line.
Some of the friendliest and most helpful staff that I have experienced in my travels. The room was perfect and the bar was cozy. A decent fitness center as well. Walking distance (10 minutes?) to the World Conference Center
Our car was stolen from the locked portion of the hotel parking area
"nice property with clean, well-furnished guest room, pleasant lobby, generally attentive staff... EXCEPT housekeepers loudly knocking on doors and going about their business during morning hours, loudly enough to too early awaken this humble correspondent, housekeepers turned a good experience into something less"
"This hotel is very close to ATL airport and has a shuttle to get there. Do not expect anything special,the rooms are OK. I had the bad experience because the bathroom was not clean, but they compensated that with a good discount at checkout."
"Very disappointing service, atmosphere , and uncomfortable bedding. Only positive was location to Fox. Would not recommend this property. Certainly would not consider this a historical landmark any longer. Lost its grandeur!  The evening desk staff were unpleasant and unconcerned about guests."
"I spent almost 2 years traveling to Atlanta and staying at Sonesta each week. They have a great, friendly staff and the rooms are always fresh and well made. There is an evening social/small dinner available. You will love staying at this Sonesta."
I would give it a zero if possible. Old and dirty. Phone didnÃ¢ÂÂt work. Refrigerator and microwave were removed. One working ice machine in entire hotel. I would never stay at this place or recommend it to anyone.
"We didn't eat breakfast here so I obviously can't comment on that, but the rooms were large, comfortable. clean and quiet.  Staff was very professional and helpful.  It was perfect for us and I couldn't have asked for a better stay."
"Wonderful property.  Rooms were well appointed, comfortable and most importantly quiet.  

The meals during our conference offered a variety and were delicious.

The hotel was within walking distance of numerous eateries and bars.

Would definitely recommend."
"You are greeted with the most friendly, professional staff.  Large, clean, comfortable rooms with a wonderful view.  The food was delicious!  Will most definitely be on my 'Go-To' hotel list when traveling."
We enjoyed our stay here are room was very clean and big and Breakfast was very good in the perfect location was a nice touch to be connected to Ruth Chris steakhouse best steaks you can find but a little pricey but very good
Stayed at Hyatt for the MNF game. Room was clean and comfortable. The desk chair had nasty stains on it though. The room was on 4th floor just above the bar area. Even with our door closed the noise was very loud past midnight.
The bathroom makes or break a stay for me. This one did not disappoint. Loved the soaking tub. (So did my wife). Everything else was as fine as you would expect for the price point. Amazing view and breakfast to die for
"The quality of the rooms was excellent, service good and very welcoming.Location in mid town close to the park and facilities is excellent.Gym is well equipped and air conditioned.Food in lobby restaurant was very good and service good."
"Clean and modern. Almost perfect, needed a bath tub. Within 5 minutes of airport. Kitchenette had everything needed except for your groceries. Computer work station, with internet access. Bath had necessary accessories."
"I stayed at this hotel during the Dragon con event labor day weekend.  The room was nice.  The staff were very friendly, greeting me every time I came in despite it likely being a crazy hectic weekend, with the Chick filA bowl and Dragon con."
"Great stay for downtown Atlanta - can be noisy because, well, it's downtown Atlanta - but a good stay nonetheless.  Rooms are large and well appointed.  Easily walk indoors to Marriott Marquis, Peachtree Center."
"Breakfast got old and tired after 15 days no variety.  Shuttle bus drivers did not help with my luggage. And they have a problem cleaning the rooms, 3 days they forgot to clean my room or leave soap or shampoo"
"Really good experience, room clean and comfortable, nice size pool, enough parking lot, excellent bar, lobby and restaurant amenities, excellent for business trips and family, really quite place to stay, it is located near to building offices but also near to malls and plazas."
"Clean rooms, helpful staff, Ruth Chris next door! I couldn't ask for a better experience! My family raved about the good food and the overall ambiance! I would recommend this hotel to everyone! Thank you"
"This was our 4th stay at the hotel. It is conviniently located, has large 2 room suites with big bathrooms and good facilities like pool, gym, bar and restaurant, all at a reasonable price. Watch out for the pricey parking, though."
We've stayed here 3 times for medical procedures at Emory hospital. The staff are amazing. They remember us and are always concerned for my friend's condition. The shuttle service to the hospital is wonderful. The concierge is top notch. The food service is outstanding.
The hotel was overall a good experience. Love the location! The cleanliness could have been better. Terrance that works there and helps with catering is AWESOME and very friendly and helpful! We thoroughly enjoyed his company during the conference!
"Took my kids on a mini vacation to Atlanta. We stayed at the Hyatt place Buckhead, the room got partially cleaned on the second day.  The van transporter was rude multiple times. My issues reported to hotel, manager from this location is yet to call"
"Overall a great higher end hotel!  Staff in Buckhead are very attentive and always asking if they can do something for you.  Hotel is well kept and a very nice location.  Nice lounge/bar area.  Prices a little high, but its the Ritz!"
This is an excellent place to stay just north of downtown Atlanta. The room was spacious and very comfortable with very good wifi connection. The breakfast was very good with several selections of hot and cold items. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Staff is very friendly. Pet friendly hotel. The food aas good in the restaurant and the free breakfast. There were lots of options in the breakfast buffet both hot and cold. Rooms were very clean. Bed was comfy.
"Everything was perfect.. enjoyed stay at this hotel. Location is so perfect, very close to mall, metra station which is connected to airport, commutable to Atlanta downtown.. Lots of food options around hotel. And most importantly very safe."
"I love the remodel. ItÃ¢ÂÂs like being on the Madmen set. The bed was comfy and the room was quiet- which was surprising considering the NCAA insanity going on around it. The staff was lovely, and the young man behind the bar was delightful."
"Hotel was conveniently located, clean, and comfortable. Front desk staff courteous and professional. I wish the keurig in our room had worked, but free coffee in the lobby was the next best thing. Nice stay."
"Excellent stay. Friendly staff, bar on site, breakfast was amazing, and in walking distance to great food. Enjoyed my stay here greatly. The overall experience was fantastic. Definitely would stay here again."
We stayed before a cheer completion it is just 5 minutes from conference center in about five minutes from the airport. Stayed there last year before going to Europe. Very friendly staff very comfortable hotel
Great place. Rucha was always helpful and friendly. The rest of the stagg were great at well. Rucha definitely went above and beyond at all times and always had a smile on her face. I am here on business but would come back for pleasure.
The staff was friendly especially the ladies working the breakfast area. The rooms are spacious. The bathroom was tiny and old. The tub was stained and the grout missing in some areas making it look dirty
"Homewood Atlanta Airport is clean, friendly, and is easy and fast to check-in early or the day of my reservation. I will stay again next time in Atlanta. The nightly social food dose not have the variety that Homewood used to."
"The Westin Buckhead was beautiful, clean and we had a great view of the city. It was our anniversary and champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were waiting for us in our room. So thoughtful! Thank you!"
We have stayed at several staybridge and the like hotels. These work well for our family of 5. This one had plenty of room a nice indoor pool and a decent breakfast. We recommend this place for families especially when visiting downtown Atlanta
"Very well-designed hotel with very well-designed rooms, friendly, customer-oreinted staff, adn next to one of the best casual restaurants in Atlanta.  Close to business destinations, restaurants, and retail stores.  Easy to access and get to central Atlanta neighborhoods"
I stayed at the sixteen-level (room #1601) yesterday. The water pressure was so weak and there was no hot water as well. This was very disappointing. My recommendation is to avoid upper levels of this hotel.
"great location and only 5 minutes from terminal 1. very average hotel. not to the same standards of a holiday inn that you would find in Asia, Singapore. customer service is very good but the USA brand is lower class. Rooms ok. staff are polite.."
"check-in time was 3:00pm, room not ready until after 7:00pm.  one towel provided for party of six.  room was clean, location nice.  just VERY disappointed in MAJOR check-in delay and NO parking availability on site."
"Couldn't have had a better experience. The hotel appears to be brand new, the staff were friendly and helpful, and the location near Georgia Tech campus and McCamish Pavilion was perfect. Will definitely stay here again."
We always stay here when we go to Atlanta. The rooms are spacious and don't feel like hotel rooms.  Breakfast is hot and adequate.  We don't care for the turkey bacon or chicken patties but there is plenty else to eat.
Interacted with Connie a lot during social hour. She is such a sweet and helpful young woman. Just what southern hospitality is about. What a great person to have come in contact with. Very nice to have met her .
I truly enjoyed the location and overall Westin experience.  Everyone was pleasant and very helpful.  I would like to visit Atlanta in the future.  I will most certainly consider the Westin when booking accomodations.  Thank you!
Just a quick stay overnight coming and going on our trip and Embassy Suites Hotel was wonderful! The room was very nice and clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Don't hesitate to stay here. Very close to the airport so it was very convienient.
"We loved staying at this hotel. It's in a suburb of Atlanta, so it's a bit of a drive to get downtown. We loved everything about this place. We would definitely stay here again!"
We are thrilled that you enjoyed your stay with us and look forward to hosting you in the future!
"Stayed here for a missed layover. These airport hotels are usually very uncomfortable and depressing. This hotel has a shuttle, good food and comfortable beds. I would recommend this place for a hotel near the airport."
"This is a really nice hotel and very clean.  Real close to the airport for those flying out early in the morning.  As far as noise from airplanes, we didn't hear a thing.  Beautiful lobby area and a very friendly staff."
"The hotel was under a remodel while my family was staying there. We were on a remodeled floor there was fresh paint and new beds, but it was below my expectations of a Ramada hotel."
"We are glad to hear that you had a perfect stay with us and look forward to having you stay with us during your next visit.

Thanks"
"This hotel was clean & nice. Location was about 10-15 minutes from everything we needed in Atlanta. Staff were professional & helpful when we needed them, which was rare due to our short stay. The bed was a little too soft for my personal preference."
"I stayed at the hotel for a conference and I was highly satisfied. Hotel staff was great, I had a great view of the city,  the breakfast was one of the best. The room was very spacious and has a microwave"
What a fantastic location as well as accommodations. Served as a hub for everything we wanted to do and see - New FalconÃ¢ÂÂs stadium; Olympic Park; GA Tech; Coke;the Wheel; Church; the Varsity Restaurant; NancyÃ¢ÂÂs Pizza!
"It was overall really nice , I must admit( staff were friendly), wifi was great, room was simple but cozy & i slept good. Loby area was big to relax & the hotel was off of the main road. I would stay again."
"Great staff. Very friendly and personable. Great fitness center, very good but very expensive breakfast and everything at the lounge is good but very overpriced. The room was very nice with a comfortable bed and great water pressure in the shower."
"I didn't like staying on the 1st floor next to valet. It was way loud, but other than that I really enjoyed the Hotel. Great environment. Great Bar. Great People. Close to a ton places. I would definitely stay here again."
This hotel has an excellent downtown location. The helpful and friendly front desk staff went the extra mile to make our stay enjoyable and stress free. We would recommend this hotel to families visiting the city.
"I love the personalities and customer service of the front desk staff. The rooms were nice and the beds were extra comfortable. It's a pretty decent location because its near everything and an uber or lyft, etc ride isn't really expensive to the major attractions."
This hotel is great. Outstanding customer service. The breakfast was great and included with your stay.They also offer shuttles for nearby restaurants. Definitely recommend this hotel to anyone especially families with kids. Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ½Ã°ÂÂÂÃ°ÂÂÂ½
This hotel was very nice. our bathroom was a little small and the door to the shower was oddly placed but the room was very clean and comfortable.  Shuttle service to airport is convenient and made our travel a little easier.
"Was there for a school conference.received a reduce rate through school. Rooms were good, privacy was great. Restaurants are pricey but close places to eat.the hotel was busy so elevators and stuff were packed. Staff was great and very helpful"
Superior hotel with an incredible staff and location. Next to the aquarium and across from Centennial Olympic Park. The food is excellent and there are lots of good restaurants in the area. It is an easy 0.5 mile walk to downtown shopping and more parks.
"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for week long conference.  The hotel property itself was clean and comfortable, and the food and service was outstanding.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for business or personal stay."
The buffett breakfast was yummy! The beds rock and the bathroom was clean. The location is just so-so... You are close to the expressway though. The hotel staff could be a bit more friendly but other than that it was a nice hotel.
The price is appropriate for the quality.  The rooms need a refresh.   Just doesn't feel like the doubletree level.  Check in manager was very pleasant.  Parking is close to the front door.  No premium channels (HBO).
"Omni CNN Center in Atlanta is near the new convention center and the Mercedes Benz Stadium. Staff is all very helpful and friendly. The rooms are very plush, bedding is great! Morsel's Coffee Shop in the north tower was a disappointment."
"I already said eveything I have to say.  Just read it and you will know.  You are first class in every way, but very expensive for people who are on a fixed income.   No senior discounts that you can see."
Excellent place to stay if you wanna be in the center of Downtown Atlanta. Valet parking provided for 35 per night. 1.4 miles from the FOX theatre. Hotel is within walking distance of CNN. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful. Breakfast is excellent.
I just love this Omni! From check-in to check out the staff did everything they could to make my stay an enjoyable experience. It definitely pays to be an Omni member. Best place to stay in downtown Atlanta
"Hotel is under construction right now so not ideal until it is finished. But the hotel was great, check in was smooth and easy, and the rooms were fantastic. Very large and comfortable to be able to work and rest."
"Nice hotel, very friendly service, free breakfast, large studio rooms, biggest issue was the refrigerators, ice build up in freezer in a few rooms I stayed in. Check the fridges. Besides that, I would stay again."
"Nice staff, easy check in. Great top roof pool. Spacious rooms. I loved the shower made from glass seen from any corner of the room. Location is central you can reach any destination of foot. Recommended."
"Great location near the airport. Ample, well lit parking. Excellent reception staff and valet park team.  Large, modern rooms that are well appointed and modern.  Very quiet and comfortable.  Good food and good service in Martini's lounge restaurant."
"Marcell, Pamela and Akech all did an excellent job. The staff is friendly and makes you feel like family. The breakfast was great. Plenty to fill your belly. The grill had really good food. The staff at the grill were awesome. Thank you!"
"OMG!! It was absolutely awesome!!! The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The staff was amazing, very helpful!!! It's worth every penny. The breakfast area was awesome very delicious breakfast buffet. It is also in a good location."
"The hotel was clean, and the staff were professional and friendly. Only complaint is that the rooms were not sound proof. With a fire station up the street, we hear the fire truck each time it went out"
There is no self parking available at this hotel and valet parking is an additional $30 per day for hotel guests. The only off-site option recommended by the staff was an $8 per day outside lot that did not appear secure.
"This is a great price for a cozy in town well kept hotel with a great staff. We booked several rooms from the internet and wasn't really sure what to expect, but our expectations were exceed. We will return."
"Three day business trip,check-in was very good,had to wait for a handicap accessible room close to the elevator.Which the young lady graciously accommodated my request.This is a yearly business trip,and the bell service is excellent.Shuttle service is great."
Very modern dÃÂ©cor with a very young and inexperienced staff.  The rooms were excellent for sound and sleep.  Only a 20$ uber ride from the airport and not a family stay place.  Great for business or single life in the city of Atlanta!
"We were happy to host you, thanks for staying !"
Great place to stay over night.  Fantastic Breakfast.  Clean and room that was large and spacious.  Employees were friendly and helpful.  My wife and I arrived late and we were still able to obtain good food at the bar.
"The rooms were clean and updated. The staff was all very nice. There is nowhere to park though, you have to use their valet and parking is $28 per night. The hotel is near lots of bars and restaurants."
Very nice hotel for price and the breakfast was outstanding the location was in a safe area and very easy access to freeways the hotel was going through a remodel which made it a little more difficult to navigate
"Excellent staff, great breakfast witb healthy options! Convenient location near Phipps plaza and Lenox Square mall. Local shuttle provided is great and operates within a 2 mile radius. This is a much appreciated service due to the lack of parking in this area!"
"My family and I were very happy with the location of the hotel. right next to the Georgia Aquarium and Coca Cola Museum. everything was in walking distance. not far from the airport, which we took an Uber to get to hotel."
I had a great time at this hotel. The staff were great and helpful. This hotel is right in the middle of downtown ATL and it was in close proximity to many wonderful restaurants and shops and things to do.
The location was great! The staff was friendly but the bathroom and kitchen needs to be upgraded otherwise this would be a 5 plus rating!  Great location directly accross from the Fox Theater. I will stay again!
We took a family trip to Atlanta.  This is a very nice hotel with exceptional staff.  Rooms were large with an excellent view of the downtown.  Weekend rates are very reasonable.  It is very convenient to MARTA; right across the street.
"On a few occasions I needed assistance with late night check in's.  Lucas and team were amazing, remembered me each time I come and always get me checked in quickly.  Valet, room service and housekeeping are also on point!"
Great service...Nice room...perfect view...The General Manager was absolutely warm and welcoming...Great cup of coffee each morning in the restaurant...Centrally located to everything...Keep up the good work.
Breakfast is not included and food and drink prices are high.  Clean and everyone is friendly.  Free shuttle to and from. SunTrust Park. Would stay here again.  Hotel is pretty quiet as it is somewhat secluded.
Room was very clean and spacious I travel 7-8 times a year normally go to Atlanta 2-3 times this was one of my favorite places to stay.
I've stayed at the W several times and it's always been a very great Hotel. The service is excellent the room quality is very good. The pool on the 16th floor is a great way to beat the hot Atlanta summers.
I greatly enjoyed our stay.  The Front Desk personnel were completely professional as well as being extremely helpful and informative.  The room was very clean and the staff kept it that way.  A very enjoyable stay.
"I spent my birthday week at the St. Regis and the hotel accommodations were Amazing. The hotel staff was the best and they catered to all of our needs. 
I would strongly recommend staying here again. I loved the hotel and had an amazing time."
"I really had a wonderful stay in this hotel, rooms, facilities, lobby and the restaurant are great!!! and the staffs are very friendly and awesome! I'm looking forward to stay in this hotel again!!! :)"
"This is a wonderful hotel in downtown Atlanta. 
It is located very close to Phillips Arena and Mercedes Benz Stadium.
The staff is friendly and always willing to help answer any questions or provide you with whatever you need."
The staff was engaging and cheerful. All appeared to enjoy their job. The rooms were clean and modern. There is no bed like my bed at home and this is the only reason I dropped a star for sleep quality.
"Whether it was the front desk, the parking attendant, the restaurant staff--all the staff here were friendly and provided professional service.  Room was great.  Will definitely stay here next time I am in the Buckhead area.  Close to everything."
"First stay at a Ritz. Met my expectations. One comfortable king bed, decent sized bathroom, good desk, small foyer. Kids loved the jelly bean and candy bar in the lobby. Only wish is that Marriott Gold were treated better. Polite, helpful, friendly staff."
My son and I stayed here during his birthday weekend. I wasn't impressed at all with this Embassy Suites. It's old and smelly and the guy making breakfast was extremely rude to everyone. I will not be staying here again.
"Wonderful breakfast, friendly staff, Nice bed, you have to pay for Parking 5 dollars a night. Very close to shopping areas. Also the gym wasnÃ¢ÂÂt fully available and they gave passes to LA fitness gym!!   thank you"
Thx. so much for your review. We're so glad you were able to use our shuttle! Hope you can stay with us again soon!
A nice gem in midtown.  The rooms are a business style upgrade over a residence inn.  No concierge lounge but they offer a voucher good for points or their continental breakfast (costs a few bucks more for to order items/hot buffet)
The staff was excellent! The pool and jacuzzi were the reasons why I chose this hotel and I was very disappointed that the pool and the jacuzzi were temporarily out of service during my 3 day stay 11/24/16 - 11/27/16
"The complimentary breakfast, the cook, restaurant employees, shutter service to airport and receptionist were  excellent alone with other the employees that worked there. My family and I really had a great time here and the location was perfect for. 5 *****"
"I like this brand for the large TV's and the skillet breakfast.  But most of all the bedding is of such good quality when rest is my number one priority, you would be hard pressed to find another brand offering more value."
"The staff was professional, friendly and efficient. Room was clean and well-appointed. The staff at front drive was very professional and helpful. Room service was prompt and food was very good. The gym was great as was the pool."
"I've stayed here twice and highly recommend this hotel.  The staff is extremely professional, the rooms are amazing, and the food and bar area are exactly what I needed after a long day of meetings!  Definitely one of the best experiences I've had in Georgia!"
Beautiful hotel in a very convenient area. Parking is expensive ($45 a night) but overall wonderful experience. The beds we're very comfortable. Sparkling grape juice and chocolate covered strawberries were in our room upon arrival.
"clean, convenient, friendly hotel. loved the free and full breakfasts, the bowls of apples and newspapers and the free shuttle to anywhere within 3 miles as well as the free checkered cab to the zoo and the friendly happy staff. choose a west facing room."
Although this hotel can have more of a business reputation we had a great vacation there.  Love the location right in the heart of Midtown Atlanta near Piedmont Park.  Very clean rooms at a better than expected rate.  Showers and housekeeping are terrific.
I stayed at the Emory Conference Center Hotel on a business trip. We also held a meeting there. The hotel and meeting area was excellent! I would recommend this hotel to everyone! The rooms were very comfortable and check in was very easy.
"One of the best hotels in midtown, friendly staff, best food for your bucks, they offer buffet for about 14:95 plus Tax. The hotel is kids friendly, they offer a full bar services, room service, also a few blocks from the Georgia institute of technology."
The staff here were amazingly wonderful! The experience I had was possibly one of the best experiences staying in a hotel in my professional career! Thanks for a great stay! I hope to be able to stay here again in the future!
We are happy to hear that overall you enjoyed your stay with us and look forward to your return again!

"As always, the Ritz doesn't disappoint! The staff can't do enough for you and I think they really enjoy making you feel like royalty. Everyone should train their staff personnel the way the Ritz trains theirs. Their people make all the difference!"
The service was great and the hotel had great amenities.  Very nice conference facilities and spa.  I had a beautiful room and the beds were very comfortable!  The location is about 20 minutes from the airport.
I would return to this hotel anytime. Never before have I been greeted by my first name coming and going from a lobby. They could not have been more accommodating. Great breakfast prepared by a loyal employee of more than 30 years. Wonderful experience.
This hotel is in a quiet location and a nice private area in which the hotel sits.  Lots of things to do in the area and across from the Galleria.  Staff is very welcoming and helpful.  Rooms clean and quiet.
"Close to Sun trust park, was disappointed there wasn't two queen size beds, in the whole hotel.  the shuttle drivers were extremely nice.  Very good breakfast, and the servers were nie and courteous.   No shuttle to the airport."
"Thx. so much for your comments. We've shared them with our team. We're glad you enjoyed your stay. Hope you'll join us again, soon!"
"The staff did not clean the rooms. We stayed there 4 nights and the room was not stocked properly and it wasn't cleaned properly. The cookies were good and warm and most of the staff was friendly, but I need a clean room."
Great experince.  Everyone at the front desk was very helpful.  Very large rooms.  Had breakfast in restaurant and the complimentary smoothies were awesome.  Would definitely stay on a return trip to Atlanta.

The service was good and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Tyrone the courtesy driver was very helpful and polite and also Danyell. The staff overall was great. I will recommend this location. Should offer pick up from airport.

Our family of 5 enjoyed our spacious suite and the hotel location.  Nice clean rooms and the complimentary breakfast worked well for all of us.  We will definitely stay at this location again the next time we travel through Atlanta.
"Loved our stay!  Very family oriented but would have preferred the rooms have a DVD player in them.  Within walking distance to the Aquarium, Coca Cola Museum, Civil Rights Museum and other attractions."
"This stay was horrible we had dirty covers some days the hotel was not cleaned.Very rude employees Never again! I called 4 time different times and got all different answers and when asked i was told ""well this is policy"""

"I stay here for business and it's always great, very convenient to where I need to go in Atlanta.  The mobile app makes it very easy to check out, just wish they had a rewards program for frequent visitors."
We were greeted with a friendly welcome in the valet department and also once we entered the hotel. Check in was effortless and the hotel room was clean and spacious.  Will definitely return whenever I visit Atlanta.
"The only thing I had an issue with was not having a microwave and refrigerator in my room. Also, not being able to open the window."
Excellent space and service for event and price. Staff was accommodating. Complimentary breakfast is a plus. Lots of attractions and restaurants near by in walking distance. Common areas on each floor is a nice addition.
"No elevators,we are all seniors. Had to walk up to 3rd floor. That was stated on website. A very very small continental breakfast.  More like a sack lunch..no door mirrors for dressing. No ironing board in our room. Not happy for the price"
"I have come to expect a certain level of comfort, courtesy, Quality, efficiency,  friendliness, and attentiveness from the places I stay.  I have yet to be disappointed at the Embassy Suites at Centennial Park - Atlanta."

"Very clean and modern hotel. Breakfast was about as good as any other hotel breakfast. Staff was friendly enough, not rude, but not overly friendly either. Just helpful if needed. Great stay for the price paid."
"Our visit was for a last minute trip. We were pleased to get reservations and, as always were treated like royalty. From the front desk to the housekeeping staff, truly first class. This property is highly recommended."
"There was a bad odor in the hallways. The restaurant food was horrible l. Overall I didn't enjoy my stay. My husband is not picky about where he stays, but he said that he will never stay at this hotel again."
"Pretty decent. Good Breakfast, good view, proximity to Olympic park. Lighting and fixtures a bit dated.  Service can be better, service staff and people are very friendly always looking to serve and help if possible."
"My family and I stayed here while I had a procedure done at Northside Hospital. All the staff, including front desk, restaurant, housekeeping, etc., were amazing. Very friendly and helpful. Not to mention the location is convenient, and the rates are awesome."
A friend and I stayed with our 2 daughters...the hotel is setup more for a business center but our stay was exceptional. The staff were great - every request was met with enthusiasm. I would recommend this hotel to families and business travelers.

"I stayed at the Intercontinental Buckhead during a 3 day work visit. Great restaurant, very nice staff. One detail: I ordered room service food the 1st night, and the food was not good; way too salty."
"Booked 11 customers in for 3 nights. Has to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed at and I travel throughout Africa, Europe and US. Staff is extremely  rude and inefficient. Save your money and find another hotel."
"This hotel was excellent, and there were so many places that were in walking distance, there was no reason to use your car while staying there.  The decor was very nice, and the hotel staff was pleasant and always attentive."
Everyone was very welcoming! Great city view! Clean room! Perfect! Would definitly be staying here when we go back to Atlanta. It is worth every penny for sure! They are doing it all right when it comes to customer satisfaction!
"Premium location, near restaurants, nightlife and shopping. The staff were friendly and helpful from the minute we valeted the car until we checked out 2 days later. The beds were extremely comfortable as well which made for a very restful sleep each night."
The location wasn't the best very dark coming into the hotel at night. Overall our stay was excellent. Beds were very comfortable. Loved the decor. Both in the room and lobby. Hotel has a bar and restaurant although I didn't get to try them out.
Good break. Nice modern decor hotel. Larger than average rooms! Hotel was everything that was advertised. Really like the net up of the studio suite. Would try to find one on my next trip out of town.
Always clean and friendly!  The renovations are coming along nicely. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure my stay is enjoyable. I've been staying here for years several times a month. Close to new stadium.
"Beautiful hotel. Room was pretty and clean. Front desk staff Bryan could not have been more helpful, professional and welcoming. I am very particular about hotels and service. I would stay here again for sure."
This day was to bring some joy to my cousin because we had just buried her father my uncle on her birthday so we wanted to bring her some joy and Life to her special day it was a great day great location great staff

Thank you,"

This is our 3rd stay & will be back for sure!!"
Always a top notch experience at this four seasons.  The staff and hotel excellent.  The rooms comfortable.  Enjoy staying at this Hotel for business.  The bar is very nice and always jumping.  Would love updated gym equipment.
Bar is cool and has good inside and outside seating with great staff. Rooms very comfortable. Good wifi. Good central location. Great gym.  Downside probably the lack of breakfast buffet. I liked the place.
"Recent stay was restful and enjoyable.  Hotel provided comfort, peace and quiet and convenience to flights departing the next day from Hartsfield.  The hotel is a but older but the room was in great shape; the hotel staff was professional and courteous."
"Since undergoing a major renovation, not only are the facilities beautiful and very functional, but the staff's attitude and helpfulness is much better. I would highly recommend the Atlanta Airport Embassy to business and leisure travelers. You will not be disappointed."
Great shout out to t Erica and Marlon- thank you Michaela W!  Cheers- Zach

excellent! i've found my home away from home at a very good rate. breakfast was very good. room was very clean and stylish. nice shower. my room had a microwave inside that was very good for late night snacks or warming up food.
The pool area is great for family fun. You can bring items to grill and pool toys for the kids and have unlimited fun family time. The location is great with lots of food and shopping within two to three miles!
Quality hotel for a decent price. The amenities in this location were fairly well kept. The staff was courteous and respectful.  The rooms were clean and the location is surroned by many good places to eat.
Great sound proofed modern hotel. Nice walk in shower with good pressure. The bed is really comfortable though the pillows could be a bit bigger. Good quality HD TV. The Air con/heating works very well. A nice touch to have a balcony. Fast free WIFI
"This hotel is an excellent place to stay, I would recommend it to anyone traveling to the north side of Atlanta. Breakfast was wonderful, staff is friendly and room was comfortable and above expectation."
The Residence Inn Atlanta Downtown is an an older building restored to Marriott standards. The rooms are spacious and comfortable - staff friendly and helpful. It is located within walking distance of many sites Atlanta has to offer. A full breakfast is included. Enjoy!!!
The rooms was large enough to cover 6 people comfortable. the check in process was easy and the breakfast was wonderful. Would recommend and stay at again. Location was easy to get to sites and in walking distance to restaurants. Beds are a little small.
Our stay was so awesome!! All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Taylor at the front desk was especially memorable. He was such a good employee and made our stay better. We will for sure be back when we visit Atlanta again.

I was excited about this trip to this hotel but was very disappointed. The breakfast was cold and lackluster. Nice room but food was blah. Valet was horrible. Will never stay here again. That's all I have to say.
This hotel is very nicely remodeled. Room is spacious and clean. The breakfast is a rse and cook to order or you can get the buffet with just about everything you want! The staff is so friendly and the shittle drivers are great too!
Four Seasons Atlanta was te perfect place to celebrate our anniversary! Make sure you stop by Bar Margot and ask for JP behind the bar. Great guy!  Jonathan and Katherine at the concierge desk are experts with what to do and where to eat!
This was a couples weekend and we really enjoyed our stay. Clean friendly staff. Nice sitting/patio area. Pool table an indor pool a plus. Breakfast not good though. The choice wasnt great. I will definitely stay again.

"Solid accommodations, clean spacious rooms with full kitchen. Laid our nicely, breakfast was very good, many selections. 

Night staff was not as friendly as I would expect. Day staff almost made up for it with their service. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel."
How on earth has no one posted accurate pictures of this place. It's one strong gust away from falling down. Stains everywhere. Dingy. The walls are yellow. Carpet coming up. Should have known better and stayed somewhere else. Avoid at all costs!
"The staff is this hotel's greatest asset (Demi at the front desk in particular is always extremely sweet and personally attentive). They're personable and always willing to help. Good paid food options, great executive lounge staff, and clean rooms."
"Excellent comments, we are happy to make your experience memorable."
"Wash cloths were not replenished, loud late night discussions among staff members outside of my room, clogged shower that was not fixed after complaint, toilet paper was not replenished, a lot of non guests hanging around lobby and front entrance."
"We stayed here for the weekend and have no complaints. Everyone was friendly, room and view was superb, and the food was rather delicious! The location was convenient and quiet. Would definitely come back again!"
N/a.....Not the best hotel for me. Needs some work. Room was nice but no microwave in room. Food quality not the best. Breakfast not the best. Overall probably want say here in the future. Staff was good.

Scheduled for major renovations next month. Excited to see how it will look on our next visit. It does need updating.

Had to make a trip for a memorial service and the hotel was very convenient. The staff was very friendly and I truly enjoyed my stay.
"Overpriced.  Useless, art-deco, trashy furnishings.  Tiny room.  Rude, condescending staff.  Pervasive, offensive perfume / air freshener smell in lobby and throughout the hotel.  Ignored my room requests, even though I am Platinum status.  Wouldn't allow GrubHub to come directly to my room."

"Thx. so much for your comments, and for being our guest. We're so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Please come back soon!"
"The hotel staff was really nice and professional. They hotel need to do some target cleaning of items like headboards, fixtures, etc.  I would make a huge difference in ordering a cleaning environment despite the traffic."

"Our recent stay at The Hyatt North was great!  We were able to check-in on time, and our check-out was efficient. The service we received was excellent and we truly enjoyed our stay at The Hyatt North in Atlanta."
The biggest surprise was the sound proof of the room.  We were in room 408 and you could not hear any noise for a busy downtown street.  The rooms are well appointed.  The bed is very comfortable.  Slept well in the bed.
The customer service was amazing! The room was spotless and the views were great! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone considering a spacious and chic hotel room in downtown Atlanta close to attractions.
"Loved the location. Excellent room. Loved the private sitting area. We had a problem with the remote, someone came and fixed it with in five minutes of our call. Would absolutely stay again. Staff was very accommodating ."
The office staff was PHENOMINAL! That also spewed over into the restaurant where we also were treated like family instead of guests! Our stay was amazing and we will be back SOON! This hotel was simply AMAZING!

The 2 queen beds were very saggy & we requested that they both be turned! This was not done! We were very dissatisfied that our request was not accomplished after calling the problem in to the staff care line!
Great to read your review BoudreauxD and for the shout outs to Tiffany and Stephen.  Look forward to seeing you again when back in Atlanta.  Cheers- Zach
Staff was very nice and clean comfortable bed in downtown shuttle van will take you 3 miles and under very convenient to have the breakfast ok but convenient as well especially on a go.will stay again
"Good location however parking is about 20% of room rate. Staff is friendly and accommodations are clean. Location allows access to many restaurants, shopping mall and other venues. Reception snacks need to be more varied and healthy instead of just salsa and chips."
"The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean.  The breakfast is excellent.  This not your standard ""Free"" breakfast.  It does cost but it is worth it, omlettes or eggs to order.  Nice area. Good loccation."

"Service desk people were not very helpful, spoke poor English. We got stuck on elevator for 35 minutes till Firemen arrived. Our ceiling leaked from shower from room above. Prostitutes hangout there in lobby."
"The shower had mold in many places, the breakfast food was very low-quality, and the pillows were incredibly old and lumpy. Valet was not properly staffed which resulted in being late to a meeting due to waiting for my car for 15+ minutes."

"This place is amazing!  The decor, the prices, the beautiful rooms!  I've never been so happy to stay in a hotel.  The staff is professional and really goes out of their way to make you happy!  I wouldn't stay anywhere else!"
This was our first time at the W. Nicholas at the front desk was awesome! Helped and answered every question we had. Also mentioned near by attractions that we can go to! The room was clean and comfortable.
From the complimentary full breakfast better than most restaurants to the convenient and fully walk-able location to the complimentary evening reception to the beautifully spacious room - this hotel outdoes itself.   All staff were also very friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay again.
"Staff was unprofessional, carpet in room filthy, could hear meeting going on next door in our meeting room, staff was cussing at another employee in banquet hallway and could hear in meeting room, internet goes in/out all day long."

"Most excellent hotel and staff. Aside from some idiot-guest smoking and setting off the fire alarm at 5 in the morning, the stay was perfect!"
"Older style hotel with weak service mind set. Housekeeping sort of lax, missing toiletries. Beds are too soft for me and I thought room was a bit dingy. Not my first choice and desk staff was not particularly welcoming."
"Our room was on the 25th floor.  We arrived at night where our room overlooked the beautiful SkyView in the background.  Our room and bathroom were clean. Staff was helpful, prompt, and courteous.  Will definitely be back.  One of the best Valet services in town."
"It far exceeded my expectations.  Close to everything, the staff were the best I have ever experienced. The value was above average. The breakfast was fresh and excellent. The value for me was above average."
"Stayed here for business located by new braves stadium.  Overall it was good.  I might try another hotel though next time I go there for business, just for comparative purposes.  Oh, only Valet parking, which was somewhat of a pain."
"I literally overnighted in this hotel between flights.  It is conveniently located in relation to the airport and offers a free shuttle service to and from the airport, Has a good snack selection in the lobby to stock up for you flights."
"We enjoyed our stay in Atlanta, GA at the Onmi CNN Center. We were there for the FCCLA National Leadership Training. The staff was very helpful when needed. Valet was excellent service. The convenience of the location was very handy."
"Check in was easy. The room clean and very modern. We had a nice view of the mountains from our room. Breakfast was decent, consisted of eggs, sausage links, potatoes, fresh fruit, yogurt, biscuits and gravy, waffles, cereal, various breads, teas, and coffee."
"This is one of those decadent hotels that has a great spa and wonderful restaurants and shopping within a few blocks. Plus,  it's across the street from a Whole Foods. The service is great too! The restaurant I  site is a great brunch spot too!"
I enjoyed my stay the staff was great! The bartender made great drinks. Only problem was when I went to go to breakfast they closed at 930am so I didn't get anything. Other than that it was great! Stay here!!
The hotel staff were very nice and attentive.  The room was average.  The bed was very comfortable and the housekeeping was very good; daily cleaning with fresh towels.  The outside area was not taken care.  We would stay again due to the location.
"The front desk staff, the maintenance staff & the breakfast crew were always very helpful & friendly.  The breakfast was excellent with a great variety of choices to eat every day.  Plus the hotel location was terrific for access to the Atlanta area."
"Room was large and clean;  the check-in staff were helpful despite being overwhelmed when I arrived; non-responsive to room service phone calls;  once I went to dinner in the Ã¢ÂÂrestaurantÃ¢ÂÂ, the food was average. Internet dropped several times."
"Great breakfast , pool workout area and courtesy van made getting to local restaurants easy. Would stay there again on any more Atlanta visits. Close to all important Atlanta attractions. Very clean and the staff was extremely friendly"
Very good place to stay. I enjoyed my stay . Clean room  and friendly staff. They provided to my every need if I had a problem . Breakfast wasn't that great. It overall it was a great stay. I def/lay will stay again here
"Had a great experience at this hotel.  Staff was friendly, courteous.  Breakfast was great and especially loved the Complimentary Evening Social.  Will definitely be returning in the future and will recommend to all."
"The staff was extremely helpful and the check-in and check-out process was simple! The rooms are very comfortable, and the bathrooms are very up-to-date. The valet parking was full, but there is another lot very close to the hotel."
"We stayed in this hotel for a concert at Phillips Arena and we watched the Falcons at the Georgia Dome, great location within walking distance. Room is huge with kitchen. Room was clean and quiet. I would stay again!"
hair was found under the sink upon arrival.problem was never addressed. bathroom unclean. wallpaper hanging from wall it was glued back up by staff. marijuana smell in the room. breakfast was good and front counter service was great.
I enjoyed my stay.  It was quiet and clean and the furnishings were well kept and modern.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  My only complaint is that the pillows were too soft for my tastes.  I prefer a firmer pillow.
I love this hotel.  This was my 2nd time staying here and my stay was wonderful!  I will stay there again.  The evening reception was great!  Hotel is very close to the Airport.  I will be staying there again when I return to Atlanta.
"Staff was very accommodating and location superb.  We took advantage of the concierge room which I recommend highly, a value worth using at this facility.  The whole operation of the hotel made for a delightful stay."
"Housekeeping entered my room without permission while I was away and with the DND sign on my door. I had expensive jewelry and credit cards in the room while I was away.  
Dirty towels left in floor of elevator."
Rooms are very spacious and comfortable. Price is not terrible unless you leave your car at the Valet....that will be 40 dollars a night which I think itÃ¢ÂÂs a bit too much for a guest. Apart from that great place to stay
"Prime location, close to restaurants, shopping stores, transit, and more! Customer service experience was impeccable,James and ""Bernard"" were more than what you would expect! Room was always clean, modern and very welcoming. Would definitely stay here again in the future. Thanks James and ""Bernard""."
"I was really expecting more, the hotel is nice but nothing above average (especially for a 4-star hotel and the cost per night). Staff was not polite! For three times I have questions and they were almost rude!"
"Always enjoy staying at Hyatt Place.  They have large comfortable rooms with a nice desk to work at.  Always great customer service and staff is friendly.  I stay there while in Atlanta and in Lakeland, FL."
"We were in Atlanta for a business trip and as usual, Wyndham never fails to meet our expectations. When traveling we always try to stay at a Wyndham property whenever possible since they consistently provide excellent accommodations and service."
"Location is not the best, but not the worst.  Value of rooms are ok. The front desk advised  of a $10,000,000 renovation, I'm wondering what happen to the othe $9,500,000!!  Rooms still outdated, bathroom sink did not work, rooms stink, and the bartender is rude!"
"Right from the start Ms. Oshea and company (Front Desk) were extremely pleasant and accommodating. And, When something needed attention within my room Mr. Timothy Richardson (Engineering) helped to Ã¢ÂÂMAKE IT RIGHTÃ¢ÂÂ!

J. Hunt"
"Hotel is located in convenient location right near the MARTA but property is dated and can use overhaul.  Friendly, helpful staff but carpets were well worn, beds very soft and bathrooms need updating as well.  There are better options."
"Service was unbelievable in restaurant and front desk.  Glenda's, Sammy and Steven made it a great stay. Lunch hours were over but yet the super friendly staff stayed just for us. No other hotel would be so nice about staying later to accommodate our needs."
The experience at this hotel was exceptionally great! From the front desk staff to the cleaning crew to the breakfast at. They all were on point! They had a great and wonderful selection at breakfast. The roads were very clean.
We enjoyed our corner hotel room looking over Braves stadium and Battery.  Staff was excellent.  Pool was awesome.  Food was great.  Drinks were outstanding.  It was our anniversary and a wonderful place to celebrate.  Victoria & Jimmy
One of the best Embassy Suites I've stayed at. Rooms were big and clean. The only issue I had was the snack selection during the evening reception. I have been to other embassy's that offered a much better selection. Location was great. Staff was friendly.
"Staff was very helpful, very friendly.  the Bistro was great, quick food and the women who work there were so nice.  A.C. had me laughing for 15 mins while i ordered and waited for food.

Room was clean and nice size for a city hotel."
Service is outstanding in every category!  Every person went out of his or her way to be helpful  with a cheerful attitude.  The hotel is reasonably priced for such pleasant accommodations and service.  I am pleased to recommend it highly.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Wyndham Galleria in Atlanta! The staff were all very kind and professional and attentive to my needs. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone. Thank you!!
"We stayed only one night and everything was great, hotel is clean, very good service. We stayed here before, and always had a good experience. Would recommend it, also it is very close to the airport."
Check in via mobile app. Lifetime platinum premier. No recognition. No upgrade. Internet not working in room. Called and fwd. me to main tech line. Take all other reviews in mind. Awful service for plats. no perks and not worth price.
"Hotel is very nice and classy. Modern Libby and the room was very well serviced. Quiet and a good location.
Slightly disappointed at choices in restaurant and breakfast, perhaps too trendy. 
Recommend for business travelers not ideal for families."
"In town to visit family and friends and needed something close to downtown and transportation and the Hyatt was the perfect place.  The price was much more reasonable then others, while maintaining a standard of service and comfort."
Had a lovely anniversary weekend at the Midtown Atlanta Hyatt. The room was well furnished with contemporary decor and had a nice view. Easy walking distance to the Jazz Festival in Piedmont Park. All the staff were wonderful.
"Short trip worth taking,  The food was exceptional.  The rooms were dark but the bedding was very nice.  Short shuttle ride from the airport.  I wish the did a better job locating the packages I sent prior for a presentation."
"Villa Christina is a great place to stay for business and pleasure. Located in a beautiful area. The guys working in the Lounge are awesome, really take care of the guests. The hotel is really new, great amenities."
"My room wasn't ready, it was across from elevator, backing on noisy highway - and the smallest hotel room ever!!   And I'm Platinum Elite Status - and Platinum for life. 

Staff really didn't seem to care 

Off my list, and told my team."
"I'm in the hospitality business so I am picky and this is a very nice hotel with an awesome staff. Shout out to the wonderful bartender, Danielle! We are coming back next month and hope to stay there!"
Great location in midtown Atlanta. They have a top-notch staff and the courtyard is lovely during the day and spectacular at night. The beds are comfortable and you get lots of pillows. Good location of outlets to power up your electronics.
I stayed at this hotel to attend the NSTA convention. They were super! I appreciated all their help with my many questions. The room was comfortable and clean. The hotel has easy access to Congress Center and the CNN Center.
"Love the suite concept, allows separate activities in different rooms (especially if you want to read while someone else watches TV.  Rooms are very nice.  Love the popcorn which is available for popping in the room."
"Very nice hotel. New Orleans style dÃÂ©cor.  Clean rooms and jetted tub for two. Staff was exceptional, professional, and courteous.  I would recommend this hotel . Great for new couples or just wanting to relight old flames."
The Ellis Hotel was a great experience. Housekeeping was impeccable. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms varied in size. Only complaint was that the bistro in the lobby was a little slow for breakfast service.
The rooms are very clean. The  are service is great. The bathroom supplies shampoo/soap are quality brand names. The food is first class. I stay here each time I come to Atlanta. The people at the desk are very helpful.
"The JW staff is always going above & beyond at every level, from valet to front desk to concierge representatives.  The hotel is refreshingly well maintained from common areas, the fitness center, the lounge, and most importantly, the rooms."
Very well kept facility.  Extremely professional and friendly staff.  Great facilities and pool.  Beds are small and not much room around the bed near the wall.  Location is good.
I loved this hotel. The staff was very friendly. I appreciated the free parking and the location was great as it was close to the mall and many great restaurants close by. I also used the great shuttle service. Very comfortable stay overall.
"Very nicely decorated, clean comfortable hotel. Conveniently located at 5th & Spring Street in Midtown Atlanta.  However the staff could have been friendlier. A few smiles and change in attitudes would be welcome indeed."
I was in Atlanta for business recently and stayed here. Found it on priceline. Overall my stay there was a pretty good experience. Big and clean rooms. The gym is small but has the expected equipment which as in decent condition. Friendly staff as well.
"Hotel is too close to I-85. Very loud and sound proofing is horrible. Water heats up really low in the winter time. Breakfast selection is mediocre. Otherwise okay, but need to do something about the noise"
What a wonderful review! Thank you so much for letting us know how much you enjoyed our hospitality. We strive for every guest to enjoy such an experience with us. We cannot wait to have you stay with us again!
The room was picture perfect! The employees were very friendly and helpful!! The shuttle service was amazing!!!
"I would like to take a moment to rate Wyndham Atlanta Galleria my stay there was great thanks to Jasmine. She went above and beyond in services for me. She made my stay memorable. Thanks Jasmine

"Smooth check-in/check-out. Easy access to North/South Towers. Walking distance to good restaurant's. Quick Valet!! Quiet, Good sleep, clean room, fast elevators, good knowledgeable employee's. Will definitely stay here again!"

Thank You,"
"Great flawless stay!  Staff was exceptional starting with the airport shuttle driver, Michael and continued with Eunice and the entire staff.  The hotel was recently renovated very nicely.  Would highly recommend, the shuttle back and forth to the airport is a plus."
We stayed here for a music festival in the park nearby.  Very nice hotel.  Plenty of good restaurants with in walking distance.  Only disappointment was no hot tub in the pool area.  Very nice indoor lap pool and small exercise room.
"Loved the room with kitchen, living room and good size bedroom. Bathroom was huge with a big walk-in shower. Hotel employees were polite. Valet always had my car ready with door opened & nice comments."
"One exit from airport, next highway...so expect noise late and early.  Excellent room for business. Plenty of outlets, large desk, large reading chair, excellent bedding and firm pillows. Good service and friendly staff. 

Busy place.  Lots of travelers, airline crews, etc."
"I would definitely stay again. The room was very spacious, the linens were cozy and the staff was ready to please.  I really don't have any complaint, other than that I wish the countertop area in the bathroom was larger."
"The staff was wonderful and very helpful.  The room was immaculate. Safety of my vehicle was great, they even kept it in the garage out of the elements.  The only con was getting out of the hotel to make a left at times were difficult."
"Although this hotel was under renovation, it was still a very clean, stylish, enjoyable hotel. Food was great, service friendly and efficient, will definitely stay here again during next years Blade Show. Very close to Cobb Center and many other eating and entertainment establishments."
"Excellent service all around, great restaurants and bar. Only downfall would be $24 per night parking, but I guess that's very common in most big cities. The location was great, with many restaurants, shopping and transportation (MARTA) nearby."
"I was here for a large meeting.  Often with many people at a hotel staff become harried.  I did not find that here.  Everyone was helpful, friendly and professional.  There was complimentary internet that was fast and easy to use."

"Facility & Staff were awesome. Needed a conference room and they pulled a rabbit out of their hat. Very reasonable room rate & conference room rate. All the people I interacted with which is approximately 12 were genuine, nice, & caring."
"Easy check-in and check out. Recently remodeled. Only a short walk to AmeriMart. Clean and comfy. Limited restaurant menu, good flavor and service. Friendly staff. I recommend the American and will stay here again."
Double Tree overall was a very good experience.  The staff is excellent and pleasant. The location was convenient and we will be back again. The signage on the floors indicating the rooms could be better. The only surprise was that breakfast was not included.
"Great location very close to everything buckhead has to offer. Price was affordable for a wedding weekend, staff was welcoming and inviting. The hotel was always clean and had great options for breakfast too!"
I came to this hotel on vacation with some friends. I enjoyed my stay here. Michelle was very nice and helpful. She also had good customer service and assisted with any issues or questions that we had.
"Nice boutique hotel, in a restored 1924 building.  Bar with a courtyard, gym, and morning breakfast.  Great location by Marta, the arts/museum complex, and the Center Stage.  Price was reasonable.  Only negative was the room was a little on the small side."
"We only stayed for one night, but loved it!  The staff was great and responded to every need or want very quickly!    Beautiful rooms and comfy beds!!! Would recommend this hotel to anyone in the area. Nice restaurants within walking distance. :)"
"The staff was professional, organized, and friendly.  The market had Starbucks coffee, and was stocked with a nice selection of choices.  Our room was clean.  The valet parking was quick and convenient, but a little pricey."
"Depending on where you are dropped off, the front desk is not that apparent. But all in all a good hotel. The gentlemen at the desk were very professional. Signage could be better. Would consider this hotel again."
Very dirty- bathroom wasn't cleaned. The shower was disgusting. I also left a bag with some important items and called right after I left to pick it up. No help- basically they robbed me and don't even care!!!!
"Large, well-furnished bedroom and large bathroom (tub for shower - no handheld shower head).  We are with a large group. The hotel staff is very attentive and helpful and embodies Southern hospitality."
"I recently stayed at this Marriott for business.  The location was convenient, staff was extremely attentive and courteous.  Fitness Center was excellent, and breakfast was incredible. The rooms were comfortable and updated.  A win!"
Beautiful hotel with unexpected luxuries.   The staff was warm and friendly.  Will definitely return soon!
"Have stayed at this property numerous times and have always been satisfied with everything. Very friendly and efficient staff. The staff is as good as you will find at any hotel. Rooms are large, but the bathrooms could be a little bigger."
"If you have allergies, don't accept room 114. It was a horrid experience for 2 nights until we could get moved. The new room, inside the main hotel instead of way back in the back with exterior doors was great."
"Customer service great. Shout out to Kaelin Tharpe who was big help on several fronts. She was great. Went out of her way to help on a fax. Couple of times went to front desk, all were great. The hotel takes pride in customer service."
"Great weekend watching the Braves win the division championship. This is a Wonderful hotel, The location is great it's walkiing distance to the ball field. The staff is very friendly. Extremely clean rooms"

"Amazing staff- Amazing bar area and always perfect hotel and stay.  Four Seasons is warm and friendly , staff calls us by name no matter if we visit 2xÃ¢ÂÂs in a month or itÃ¢ÂÂs been months since theyÃ¢ÂÂve seen us-"
"No portable restrooms or handwashing stations, making a situation where no place to urinate/defecate and no place to wash your hands, neither were there hand disinfectant. Some effort should have been made in this regard."
"If you are going to see the braves this hotel offers a convenient location. The have nice lags rooms, pleasant and helpful staff, ease of access to the ballpark with the shuttle, and happy happy happy hour!"
