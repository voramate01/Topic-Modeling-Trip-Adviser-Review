# Topic-Modeling-Trip-Adviser-Review

* In this project we have decided to randomly collect reviews on Trip adviser website from Hotels 3 stars and Up. 
We wanted to know the main topics that are being discussed. This knowledge can be useful for management or maketing team to improve their day to day activities and have a better business-client relationship. 

* We collect the data from www.tripadvisor.com. The data we collected include reviews from 100 hotels in the website.
These hotels are located in Atlanta and have more than 3 stars. The data is scraped using Scrapy and stored in MongoDB.
